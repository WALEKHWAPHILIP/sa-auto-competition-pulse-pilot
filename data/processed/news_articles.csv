Speaking at a media briefing alongside Deputy Minister Mkhuleko Hlengwa, Creecy outlined her department’s intention to amend Section 65 of the National Road Traffic Act. She highlighted that this would introduce a clear and unambiguous policy, allowing no alcohol consumption while driving. Presenting the 2025/26 festive season road safety report, covering the period from 1 December 2025 to 11 January 2026, Creecy said it was time to end the longstanding allowance that permitted drivers to consume a certain amount of alcohol before getting behind the wheel. “The time has come for us to amend the law, so that we have a clear-cut, easy-to-understand, and unambiguous policy that says drinking and driving are not allowed,” she said. “If nothing else, we owe this to the memory of the many fellow South Africans who have lost their lives on the roads.” Creecy described the current law as “totally unacceptable,” noting that existing blood-alcohol limits, set decades ago, allow regular drivers up to 0.05g per 100ml of blood and professional drivers up to 0.02g. For breathalyser tests, these limits correspond to 0.24 mg/L and 0.10 mg/L, respectively. The minister said she could not explain these allowances to families who have lost loved ones in alcohol-related crashes. The festive season report highlighted why such a change is urgently needed. While five provinces recorded reductions in road fatalities, four provinces—including Gauteng, Western Cape, Mpumalanga, and Northern Cape—saw increases. The period between 15 and 28 December accounted for over 40% of crashes and fatalities, which Creecy said confirms a trend that accidents spike when travellers have reached their destinations and are engaged in festive celebrations. Drunk driving is a problem Transport Minister Barbara Creecy and Deputy Minister Mkhuleko Hlengwa The stats also show that officers conducted 1,632 roadblocks and checked 1.8 million vehicles. Over 450,000 traffic fines were issued, while 525 motorists were arrested for excessive speeding. Creecy said roadblocks focused on vehicle roadworthiness, driver fitness, and licensing, and 173,695 drivers were tested for alcohol consumption. Of these, 8,561 tested positive, marking a 144% increase from the same period the previous year. Some of the incidents were extreme. The highest recorded blood-alcohol reading was in KwaZulu-Natal, where one driver tested 14 times above the legal limit. Meanwhile, in the Northern Cape, a motorist was caught travelling at 222 km/h in a 120 km/h zone. “This reinforces the urgent need for zero tolerance on alcohol and driving,” Creecy said. The proposed change is not new. In 2020, former Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula introduced the National Road Traffic Amendment Bill to Parliament, which included measures to eliminate blood-alcohol limits entirely in favour of a zero-tolerance approach. The bill also contained amendments to driving school regulations, licensing procedures, and traffic enforcement. However, despite parliamentary debate and consultations, the bill has not yet become law. A zero-tolerance alcohol policy for drivers would align South Africa with international best practices and remove confusion about what constitutes safe driving. If implemented, it would mean that all drivers would be prohibited from consuming any alcohol before getting behind the wheel. “I have never understood why it was acceptable to allow motorists to drink a certain amount and drive. This must end,” Creecy said. She added that the lives of South Africans on the road depend on decisive action.

However, experts warn that this relatively favourable fuel price environment may not last indefinitely. South Africa has experienced a notable decline in petrol prices at the start of 2026, and another big decrease is forecasted for February. Early data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF) points to large recoveries for both petrol and diesel, helped by the stronger rand and pressure on global oil prices. Petrol prices are showing an over-recovery of around R1.20 per litre, while diesel has an even larger recovery of around R1.75 per litre. Energy expert Roland Tatnall explained that petrol prices are mainly driven by two factors: the international price of crude oil and the rand–dollar exchange rate. At present, both are working in South Africa’s favour. Crude prices have fallen sharply over the past year, while the rand has firmed against the dollar. Tatnall noted that crude oil prices have been decreasing, adding that Brent crude is currently trading at around $60 a barrel, down from about $80 a barrel at the start of 2025. “It has decreased quite significantly over the last few months. This drop in oil prices has fed directly into lower pump prices locally,” he said. At the same time, the dollar has softened, and the rand has firmed against the dollar, amplifying the relief for consumers. As long as these two factors remain aligned, Tatnall believes fuel prices should remain broadly stable. However, he stressed that this balance is fragile. “If either one of them moves, then obviously prices will change.” One of the key risks is currency volatility. Tatnall pointed out that the rand’s quite volatile, so we don’t know where that’s going to go in the near term. Even if oil prices remain subdued, a weaker rand could quickly push fuel prices higher. Conversely, while crude prices are currently low, he questioned how sustainable this level really is. “The $56 to $60 a barrel is quite low, and there are questions on how sustainable that is,” he said. A fragile balance Energy expert Roland Tatnall Tatnall also highlighted political pressure in the US to keep oil prices down. He noted that US President Donald Trump has repeatedly spoken about wanting oil prices closer to $50 a barrel. While that could be positive for South African motorists, Tatnall doubts it is realistic. “That’s really biting off the hand that feeds him,” he said. He explained that much of US shale oil production becomes uneconomical at those levels. “Onshore shale oil has a break-even price for new wells of between $60 and $65 a barrel, so pushing the price much lower doesn’t make a lot of sense.” Beyond short-term pricing, Tatnall noted that global oil demand dynamics are also shifting, particularly due to the rise of electric vehicles. “It has already had an impact,” he said, pointing to China, where electrification has removed a million barrels of oil a day from Chinese demand. He added that in countries like Norway, around 95% of new cars sold are electric vehicles. However, Tatnall does not expect this shift to dramatically reduce oil demand in the near term. “The oil industry is not going anywhere soon,” he said. While EV adoption is growing, he argued that oil consumption of roughly 100 million barrels per day is unlikely to fall drastically over the next few years. Tatnall emphasised that while current prices are lower than they have been in a long time, motorists should not assume this is the new normal. “If either the rand or the oil price moves, prices will change.” Fuel prices may remain relatively steady if current conditions persist, but South Africans should be prepared for potential volatility.

The new vehicle market delivered a landmark performance in 2025, finally recovering above 2019 pre-pandemic levels and hitting highs not seen in a decade. The upward swing is closely tied to broader economic improvements and was boosted by a cumulative 150 basis points in interest rate cuts since September 2024, due to low inflation and an influx of affordable model imports. Naamsa said that the new vehicle market concluded the year on a strong note in December 2025, with aggregate industry new vehicle sales reaching 48,983 units, a year-on-year increase of 7,882 vehicles. The December 2025 new passenger car market demonstrated a robust performance, with a year-on-year volume increase of 20.3%, while light commercial vehicles experienced a gain of 23.7%. However, truck and bus sales ended the year on a weaker note, with medium commercial vehicles decreasing year-on-year by 7.0%, while heavy trucks and buses decreased year-on-year by 13.2%. Upon examining the details, Toyota remained the largest seller, with 12,933 vehicles sold in December 2025. This was followed by Volkswagen (5,014) and Suzuki (4,961). While the rest of the top ten is comprised of cars from established brands, including Ford and Kia, there is a rise of Chinese brands, such as GWM and Chery. Chinese brands have been consistently outpacing their European rivals in sales growth in South Africa for some time. However, the Indian brand, Mahindra, has also been selling more cars. In December 2025, Mahindra sold 1,234 vehicles, making it the 13th largest vehicle seller in South Africa. The company sold more cars than Nissan, which sold 1,011 units. This was well ahead of BMW, which sold 843 vehicles over the period. It also sold more than Stellantis, which houses several major brands, including Jeep and Opel, which sold 524 units. Associated with high-end luxury, Mercedes-Benz sold an estimated 474 units during the final month of the year. While ranking 13th in December, Mahindra has consistently been among the top-10 sellers throughout the year, ranking 10th when considering data for the full year. Although Mahindra has been present in South Africa for two decades, the Indian company has aggressively expanded its market share in recent years. Its models are primarily small SUVs and bakkies. The company recently opened a R70 million vehicle assembly facility in Durban at the Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone.

Declining sales in China’s domestic vehicle sales are expected to drive a continued “Affordability Influx” as its manufacturers look outward for growth. Although the US economy presents uncertainties for exporters, the industry remains focused on securing its position in the EU, which is easily the most important export regional destination.

BusinessTech travelled on the bullet train, known as the “Shinkansen” in Japan, from Tokyo to Osaka and back again in December, and was thoroughly impressed. From start to finish, the journey was flawless and pleasant. It started with the train stations, which are far from a place to simply board a train. Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station are best described as expansive shopping centres that also serve as a place for hundreds of thousands of people to board trains each day. The stations are clean, modern, and packed with a wide range of stores. Once we entered the stations and went through our respective gates, we were greeted by restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, and general retailers. This included international brands like Starbucks and local brands such as the renowned 551 Horai. All the stores were busy with customers, but the service was quick and efficient, meaning wait times were not excessive. We purchased a tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlets) bento box for the trip, and made our way to the platform. The stations have clear markings and signage throughout, with almost all of it displayed in both Japanese and English, or switching between the two languages regularly. If you do not speak or read Japanese, you should have no issues finding your way through the stations to your train. Once on the correct platform, you get to see the bullet train in its full glory while it waits for passengers to board. We rode on the Nozomi train service on both legs of our journey, which uses an N700 series bullet train. This is the fastest option, taking a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes to travel from Tokyo to Osaka. The return trip is a similar duration. For comparison, driving from Tokyo to Osaka is a 500km journey, which Google Maps estimates takes between 5 and 8 hours to complete. The Nozomi bullet train can travel so quickly between the two cities thanks to: A top operational speed of 300km/h. It only stops at a few stations along the way, for a couple of minutes each time. The tracks for the bullet train are prioritised for its journey, meaning no disruptions or “traffic”. In true Japanese style, our bullet train arrived well ahead of its scheduled departure time, and the passengers disembarked. A cleaning crew, waiting on the platform, then sprang into action and hurried onto the train with their equipment to clean it. Within a few minutes, they were done, and we were instructed to board the train. This is another hallmark of the platforms at Japanese train stations: announcements, chimes, and warnings play constantly. If you miss a train, it is almost certainly your own fault. We purchased “Green Car” reserved seating for our trips, which is equivalent to first-class on the bullet train. This gives you a specific seat in a particular car on the train, as pictured above, which was large and comfortable. The seats can also decline and feature an adjustable footrest in front of you. For larger groups, a row of seats can be rotated 180 degrees to face the row of seats behind it. This allows for a group of four passengers to face each other. The total price for our tickets was 77,160 Yen (R8,100) – which covered two people on a Tokyo-Osaka round-trip. This works out to just over R2,000 per person for each leg of the trip. Cheaper seat options are available, and two people can take the same journey in a “normal” part of the train for 57,000 Yen (R6,000). The ride on the train was superb. It floated across the tracks at a rapid speed, and the journey was extremely comfortable. Once we departed, a bullet train employee walked down the aisle, handing out wet wipes to all passengers. The same employee made multiple trips up and down the aisle throughout the journey, smiling as she carried a large packet and asked if we had any rubbish we wanted to throw away. Riding across Japan also gave us a chance to see a wide range of scenery—from dense housing to large office buildings to expansive open fields. The facilities on the bullet train are equally impressive. There was a space for large suitcases at the back of our car, charging ports in our seats, and a bathroom which was clean and private. For those who have not visited Japan before, an entire article can be dedicated to their toilets. They provide a range of functions at the touch of a button – including washing and drying your business end, without you having to leave the seat. Getting off the train at your destination is as easy as getting on. You walk through a gate which scans your ticket and are greeted by more train lines, subway lines, shops, restaurants, and stores. South Africa’s bullet train A bullet train is not a new concept to South Africans, as the government has long been discussing the development of one in the country. A high-speed rail framework was first discussed in 2010 under the former Transport Minister, Sibusiso Ndebele, and was again promoted by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2019. More recently, in 2023, the “Limpopo-Gauteng Speed Train Project” was announced. The project then entered a feasibility study and environmental impact assessment in mid-2025. The expected launch of this bullet train is scheduled for 2030, and it is being led by the Department of Transport, in collaboration with the Gauteng and Limpopo provincial governments, as well as private investors. However, a bullet train requires a highly secure and functional railway system due to the fast speeds of the trains and the second-perfect schedules they run on. This is a challenge in South Africa, as the country’s railway systems are run by state-owned entities Transnet and PRASA, which have historically underperformed. Years of underinvestment and corruption have hindered Transnet’s ability to provide freight services across the country, while PRASA has struggled similarly in the passenger rail sector . The security of people using public transport in South Africa is another major issue to solve. Violence between taxi drivers and e-hailing drivers—such as Uber—has left people scared to use either service. Ubers and taxis would be needed to get from one’s home to a train station for long journeys. Attacks on trains in South Africa have also left commuters stranded in the past. This includes a massive arson attack in Cape Town in 2019 , where 18 train carriages were gutted. For a bullet train to operate at a world-class level in South Africa, these challenges must be addressed first.

Stellantis South Africa stated that the local recall aligns with a global recall campaign. It affects its Citroën, DS, Chrysler, Jeep, Opel, and legacy Chevrolet models. It warned that driving with an unrepaired Takata airbag poses a severe risk of injury or death. Stellantis is not the only manufacturer to have recalled vehicles due to the issues; Ford, Toyota, Honda, and BMW have also done so. The problem has resulted in the largest vehicle recall in history. Toyota stated that the recall is due to the discovery of a potential issue with certain types of airbag inflators manufactured by Takata, which may allow moisture intrusion over time. This could create excessive internal pressure when the airbag is deployed, causing the inflator to rupture. In the event of an inflator rupture, metal fragments could pass through the airbag cushion material, striking and possibly injuring occupants in the event of an accident. In South Africa, no injuries or fatalities have been reported due to this condition. Stellantis South Africa said that it has proactively contacted customers for several years and replaced defective Takata airbag inflators. Although it states that significant progress has been made, some vehicles remain unrepaired, and the Stop-Drive warning continues to be in effect. It has urged customers whose airbags have not yet been replaced to immediately stop driving their vehicles and arrange a free repair at an authorised service centre. All replacement work is then carried out at authorised service centres at no cost to customers. The affected vehicles can be found below: Citroën Citroën C3 Phase 2 (2008-2017) Citroën C4 (2010-2018) Citroën DS3 (2008-2019) Citroën DS4 (2010-2017) Citroën DS5 (2010-2018) Citroën C Zéro (2010-2017) DS DS 3 (2008-2019) DS 4 (2010-2017) DS 5 (2010-2018) Chrysler Chrysler 300 (2004-2016) Chrysler Aspen (2007-2009) Chrysler Crossfire (2007-2008) Jeep Jeep Wrangler (2007-2016) Opel Opel Astra (2005-2014) Opel Cascada (2012-2018) Opel Meriva (2009-2017) Opel Mokka (2011-2018) Opel Vectra (2003-2008) Opel Zafira (2011-2016) Opel Astra 10 (2009-2018) Opel Signum (2005-2008) Chevrolet Chevrolet Cruze (2009-2017) Chevrolet Orlando (2011-2017) Chevrolet Aveo (2011-2018) Chevrolet SPARK Chevrolet VIVA Customers can check if their vehicle is affected by visiting their car’s manufacturer’s website and entering their vehicle’s VIN in the relevant portal.

Chinese brands, in particular, have been entering South Africa at a rapid pace over the past few years, and 2025 followed this trend closely, with six manufacturers from the People’s Republic making their local debut. The only exception was Tata Motors, which marked a high-profile return to South Africa’s passenger car segment after an extended absence. According to data from vehicle analytics firm Lightstone, these launches are part of a broader shift in South Africa’s vehicle sales landscape. New brands—mostly Chinese—are steadily increasing their market share, while traditional players are being forced to rethink their strategies to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. Lightstone’s data showed that in 2000, the top six selling light vehicle brands in South Africa were Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Opel, Mazda and Ford. Together, they controlled between 60% and 70% of the market for much of the following decade. Between 2010 and 2020, that figure dropped to between 50% and 60%, before settling at around 50% from 2020 to 2023. By 2024, however, their combined market share fell below 50%, a level it has yet to recover. “New brands such as Chery, Omoda, Jetour, JAC and Beijing have steadily grown from just 0.5% in 2022 Q2 to 10% in the two most recent quarters of 2025,” said Andrew Hibbert, Data Analyst at Lightstone Auto. “These new entrants offer modern tech, competitive pricing and long warranties, helping them move from niche to mainstream.” “This is highlighted by the fact that Chery’s 2025 market share alone exceeds the combined share of Nissan, Mazda, and Opel.” Hibbert added that shifts are also evident among traditional brands. While Toyota, Volkswagen and Ford remain in the top six, Suzuki, Isuzu and Renault have replaced Nissan, Opel and Mazda among the country’s strongest sellers compared to those reporting sales in 2000. The new car brands that launched Against this backdrop, 2025’s new brand launches arrived with a wide variety of products and technologies. The first to enter the market was MG, which launched at the start of the year with three vehicles. These included the ZS crossover, the HS SUV, and the all-electric Cyberster roadster. MG has since expanded its range with the MG3 hatchback and the ZS Pro crossover, broadening its appeal across multiple segments. Tata Motors officially re-entered South Africa’s passenger car market in August with four new models showcasing the brand’s latest design language. Its initial lineup includes the Tiago hatchback, Punch crossover, Curvv crossover coupe, and the Harrier midsize SUV, marking a renewed push into the local market. Another notable arrival was Leapmotor, which stands out from other Chinese brands due to its affiliation with Stellantis, the global automotive group behind Opel, Peugeot, Citroën, Jeep and Alfa Romeo. Leapmotor vehicles are distributed through the existing Stellantis dealer network in South Africa. For now, it offers a single model, the C10 family SUV, which uses a range-extended electric vehicle powertrain. In this setup, a petrol engine acts solely as a generator, charging a battery that powers the electric motors driving the wheels. Changan and its new-energy sub-brand Deepal arrived in late October with four models. Changan launched the Alsvin sedan, CS75 Pro SUV and Hunter bakkie, while Deepal introduced the S07 electric crossover. The Hunter REEV bakkie added another electrified option to South Africa’s growing alternative-energy lineup. Shortly thereafter, Geely entered the market with two SUVs. These are the fully electric E5 and the plug-in hybrid E5 EM-i. These models represent only the first phase of Geely’s plans, with the company also intending to introduce its Zeekr, Farizon and Riddara sub-brands locally in the near future. Rounding out the year was Dongfeng, which made its South African debut in November with the electric Box hatchback. The brand has also confirmed plans to launch the 007 sedan and the 06 SUV, further adding to the expanding selection of new vehicles competing for local buyers’ attention. The seven car brands that launched in South Africa in 2025 are listed below.

The company stated that vehicle tracking devices are crucial for recovering stolen vehicles, but they can also impact insurance coverage. Many insurance policies require a tracking device to help reduce risk; however, they must be correctly installed and in working order to ensure the coverage is valid. The small gadgets are more than just a theft deterrent; they also have a significant impact on one’s vehicle insurance coverage. SAPS data showed that 86 vehicles were stolen per day between January and March 2025. Discovery Insure’s data show that while overall vehicle theft and hijacking have declined over the past two years, vehicle-related crime still tends to rise toward the end of the year. In November and December, incidents typically increase by roughly 10% compared to the rest of the year. This means tracking devices are a critical line of defence against theft year-round, and especially during the festive season. “Having a functioning tracking device in your vehicle improves the chances of it being recovered, said Precious Nduli, Chief Commercial Officer of Discovery Insure. “This lowers your risk profile as a driver and reduces the expected cost of claims, which can make your premium more affordable. Without a tracker, Nduli said that the risk might be too high for insurers to offer coverage at all, which is why many insurers need one for coverage, especially for high-value or high-risk vehicles. How a tracker affects you Discovery Insure stated that if you don’t install the device via an approved provider within a specified timeframe, your vehicle may not be covered for theft or hijacking. This condition often applies to high-value vehicles, such as luxury cars and SUVs, which are at a high risk of theft, as well as commercial or fleet vehicles. An insurer may even require more than one tracker to be installed in a vehicle if it’s deemed particularly high-risk. “If your car is stolen, the tracking device is essential for recovery”, said Nduli. “Without it, especially if your insurer has made it a prerequisite, your cover could be limited to basic third-party insurance or future claims rejected.” Tracking devices also come with additional features that benefit the driver, such as an immediate emergency response trigger. Tracking devices are also only designed to last between 18 months and two years before they need to be replaced. They can also deplete sooner if the driving profile is more aggressive, the installation is poor, or the device is damaged. “Contact your insurance provider to understand how to test if your device is not working. Some insurers will also notify you if they detect that your device is not working,” said Nduli. “If you have a third-party tracker, make sure that your subscriptions are up to date.” If you believe there is an issue, it is best to contact your insurer as soon as possible, as a delay can affect your coverage. Discovery Insure has highlighted the increased risk of hijacking in the final months of the year, and has warned motorists to check their trackers.

With more vehicles on the road and law enforcement visibility increasing at roadblocks and border posts, fraudsters are using fear and urgency to extract money and personal information from unsuspecting motorists. Fines SA has issued a warning about a surge in fraudulent SMS and WhatsApp messages claiming motorists have outstanding traffic fines that require immediate payment. According to the company, it has seen a sharp rise in consumer queries from people unsure whether these messages are legitimate, as the scams are becoming more convincing and widespread. The messages warn recipients that they face penalties, legal action, or arrest if they do not settle an alleged fine immediately. They often include a link to what appears to be a legitimate payment page, carefully designed to mimic official municipal or traffic fine platforms. In reality, these sites are cloned pages controlled by criminals, and any money paid is diverted straight to fraudsters. Fines SA stressed that it does not send traffic fine notifications via SMS. Its CEO, Barry Berman, told BusinessTech that the company has seen a noticeable spike in motorists contacting them to verify messages they have received. He explained that the scams are deliberately designed to create panic, pushing people to act quickly without verifying the information. Once a payment is made on an unsafe site, the money is gone, and no fine has actually been settled, leaving the motorist both out of pocket and still liable for any legitimate fines. One of the clearest warning signs is the web address. Any link that does not direct users to www.finessa.co.za is not associated with Fines SA. Payments made on fake sites expose motorists not only to financial loss but also to potential identity theft, as personal and banking details are often harvested for further criminal activity. The company advised motorists to treat any unsolicited fine-related message with extreme caution. Syndicates are taking advantage of increased police presence Rather than clicking on links or reacting to threats, drivers are encouraged to stop and independently verify their fine status through secure and trusted platforms. Berman added that taking a few minutes to check through a verified source can prevent unnecessary stress and significant financial loss. The warning comes as legal experts also caution that the festive season creates ideal conditions for other types of road-related scams. Ann-Suhet Marx, Director and Head of Litigation at law firm VDM Incorporated, said criminals often take advantage of increased enforcement and travel congestion during this time of year. While legitimate law enforcement operations are being stepped up at roadblocks and border posts, syndicates exploit the confusion by posing as officials or service providers to extort cash from travellers. Marx warned that not every uniform is legitimate and that criminals thrive on fear and uncertainty. Fraudsters posing as traffic officers may demand so-called “spot fines” for minor issues such as cracked windscreens, worn tyres, or expired licence discs. These demands are often accompanied by threats of detention or vehicle impoundment unless cash is paid immediately. Spot fines are illegal, and motorists cannot be forced to pay cash at a roadblock. Drivers have the right to insist on written documentation and to verify any fine through official channels. There is also a growing risk of identity theft, with syndicates requesting copies of licences or passports under false pretences, or even asking motorists to hand over original documents. Marx advised travellers never to surrender originals unless legally required and to keep certified copies available for routine checks, while safeguarding original documents at all times.

Early 2024 started with a handful of discontinuations, which turned into a major shift by the end of 2025. Familiar models quietly disappeared from showrooms, and manufacturers moved toward newer, more efficient, or more profitable vehicles. The early wave of withdrawals included several well-known cars. Subaru replaced the VX with the Crosstrek, and Kia ended production of the Rio for all right-hand-drive markets, which meant its exit from South Africa. Citroën dropped its European-built C3 and C3 Aircross and replaced them with Indian-made versions that share the same names but are completely different cars. Honda also retired the WR-V and introduced the Elevate in its place, in line with the growing demand for compact SUVs. Mahindra made a similar move by discontinuing the XUV300 and introducing the newer XUV300 TurboSport. Volkswagen discontinued its entry-level Amarok bakkie, signalling a shift in focus for its commercial lineup. Other models were discontinued due to slowing sales. Hyundai dropped the Kona, Nissan removed the Qashqai, Jeep ended the Renegade, Mazda discontinued the BT-50, and Toyota phased out the C-HR. The Nissan NP200, one of the best-selling small bakkies in the country, was discontinued because its ageing engineering could no longer keep up with modern standards. Suzuki also removed the Vitara, saying its newer Fronx and Grand Vitara already filled that space in the SUV market. The pace of changes picked up sharply in 2025, with at least 16 more models being discontinued. While many of these decisions were driven by low demand, others were tied to major global shifts in the industry—especially the shift toward electric vehicles and simplified product ranges. Jaguar made the most dramatic move. In late 2024, it announced a complete shift to electric cars as part of a major rebrand. Big exit from Ford It then stopped building all its petrol and diesel models, including the popular E-Pace and F-Type. The company has already shown off its first new concept, the Type 00, but for now, Jaguar has no new cars on sale in South Africa. Its parent company still operates locally through the Land Rover and Range Rover brands. Maserati took a similar step, removing the Ghibli, Levante, and Quattroporte from its South African lineup as it prepares to introduce future electric models. Audi continued trimming its global range, discontinuing the A4 in 2025 and replacing it with the new-generation A5. The A1 and Q2 will also be cut in 2026 as the company simplifies its offerings. Fiat discontinued the Tipo, consistent with its small footprint in South Africa. Ford dropped the Puma even though it was well-reviewed, because it was considered too expensive to compete effectively. With its removal, Ford’s only locally available passenger vehicle is the Territory SUV, alongside its strong-selling Ranger and Everest. Honda also discontinued the Ballade and BR-V in 2025, while Lexus ended the RC. Toyota made two noteworthy cuts this year, which are the Corolla Quest and the Land Cruiser 79 V8. The Quest, once one of the most affordable sedans on the market, fell victim to declining interest in sedans as more South Africans choose crossovers and SUVs. The Land Cruiser 79 lost its iconic 4.5-litre V8 turbodiesel after Toyota shifted globally to more efficient engines, leaving Toyota with no V8 models in South Africa. The 28 cars that have been discontinued in South Africa over the course of two years are listed below. 2024 Citroen C3 Citroen C3 Aircross Honda WR-V Hyundai Kona Jeep Renegade Mahindra XUV300 Mazda BT-50 Nissan Qashqai Suzuki Vitara Toyota C-HR VW Amarok 110kW Nissan NP200 2025 Audi A4 Fiat Tipo Ford Puma Honda Ballade Honda BR-V Jaguar E-Pace Jaguar F-Type Jaguar I-Pace Jaguar XE Jaguar XF Lexus RC Maserati Ghibli Maserati Levante Maserati Quattroporte Toyota Corolla Quest Toyota Land Cruiser 79 V8 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Energy · 3h Great news about petrol prices in January Wealth · 5h Discover Cyprus: A Premier Destination for Investment, Wealth Management, and Lifestyle Lifestyle · 6h The South African city voted one of the best in the world for food 5 Things · 8h US sends a threat to South Africa, and bad start for people with DStv in South Africa Government · 9h Ramaphosa waiting to sign 7 new laws for South Africa Business · 1d End of the line for 126 more businesses in South Africa Industry News Partner content Six ways to refresh your finances this festive season Partner content BusinessTech reviews – The best way to promote new products Partner content BusinessTech – Reach 5 million South Africans in one place Partner content Codehesion – South Africa’s leading Android and iOS app development company Partner content Business Talk reaches 8 million views Partner content What your board of directors should know about King V More News Energy · 18 Dec 2025 69 cents per litre pain for drivers in South Africa Government · 18 Dec 2025 Another state monopoly in South Africa comes crashing down 5 Things · 18 Dec 2025 US firm after billionaire Motsepe’s companies for R3.2 billion, and end of Post Office’s monopoly on small parcel deliveries Lifestyle · 18 Dec 2025 Warning to people visiting shopping malls in South Africa Property · 17 Dec 2025 Goodbye Cape Town – the small towns South Africans are moving to instead Business · 17 Dec 2025 Iconic 100-year-old South African company finding a new home Poll Do you anticipate a pay hike next year?

As prices soar well above inflation, the affordability of the cheapest models from Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz now requires buyers to be in the upper-income brackets. According to the latest TransUnion Mobility Insights Report, the cost of new vehicles rose only slightly in the third quarter of 2025. This index, which tracks pricing trends for new and used vehicles from 15 top-volume manufacturers, showed a 1.5% year-on-year increase in new car prices during this period. While all vehicle segments experienced price hikes, hatchbacks saw the lowest increase, with a 0.7% rise compared to last year. Despite this, over a longer period, hatchbacks—often the entry-level models for luxury brands—have seen the steepest price increases. This is evident in the cost of the Audi A1, BMW 1 Series, and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. The Audi A1, currently the most affordable option among the three, is priced at R530,900. 10 years ago, the same vehicle cost R265,000, which means the price of the model has increased by R265,900 (100%). The BMW 1 Series follows at R713,395, while the Mercedes-Benz A-Class tops the list at R813,124. These prices reflect price increases of R371,395 (109%) and R423,924 (109%), respectively, compared to 2015. These figures highlight how much the landscape of vehicle affordability has shifted, with over 75% of all cars in South Africa now costing more than R500,000. Several factors contribute to these rising costs. The weak rand and a sluggish local economy have made it increasingly expensive to import and sell vehicles in South Africa. This has had a profound impact on sales for premium brands. Over the past decade, combined sales for Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz have plummeted by 63.5% since 2014. At the same time, competitors from other markets, particularly China, have gained traction by offering competitive pricing, advanced technology, and solid build quality, reshaping the market dynamics. What you need to earn The affordability challenge becomes even starker when considering the financial commitment required to own one of these vehicles. Using the Audi A1 as an example, financing the car over 60 months at an 11.50% lending rate (prime rate of 10.25% plus 1.25%) with no deposit would result in a monthly instalment of approximately R11,771. Financial experts advise that car payments should not exceed 25% of your monthly income. By this standard, you would need to earn at least R47,100 per month to comfortably afford this vehicle. To put this into perspective, data from the World Inequality Database indicates that earning R47,100 places you among South Africa’s top 10% of income earners. This means 90% of South Africans earn less than this threshold, underscoring the exclusivity of owning even the cheapest models from these premium brands. The cheapest Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are listed below, along with the starting price, estimated monthly instalment, and monthly salary required to afford the vehicle. Audi A1 Starting price: R530,900 Monthly instalment: R11,771 Estimated monthly salary required: R47,100 BMW 1 Series Starting price: R713,395 Monthly instalment: R15,785 Estimated monthly salary required: R63,200 Mercedes-Benz A-Class Starting price: R813,124 Monthly instalment: R17,978 Estimated monthly salary required: R71,900 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Motoring · 2h Warning to anyone with unpaid fines in South Africa Motoring · 17h South Africa kissed these 28 cars goodbye Energy · 20h Great news about petrol prices in January Wealth · 21h Discover Cyprus: A Premier Destination for Investment, Wealth Management, and Lifestyle Lifestyle · 23h The South African city voted one of the best in the world for food 5 Things · 1d US sends a threat to South Africa, and bad start for people with DStv in South Africa Industry News Partner content 15 years of leading smartphone camera technology – A history of Galaxy camera innovation Partner content Six ways to refresh your finances this festive season Partner content BusinessTech reviews – The best way to promote new products Partner content BusinessTech – Reach 5 million South Africans in one place Partner content Codehesion – South Africa’s leading Android and iOS app development company Partner content Business Talk reaches 8 million views More News Government · 1d Ramaphosa waiting to sign 7 new laws for South Africa Business · 18 Dec 2025 End of the line for 126 more businesses in South Africa Energy · 18 Dec 2025 69 cents per litre pain for drivers in South Africa Government · 18 Dec 2025 Another state monopoly in South Africa comes crashing down 5 Things · 18 Dec 2025 US firm after billionaire Motsepe’s companies for R3.2 billion, and end of Post Office’s monopoly on small parcel deliveries Lifestyle · 18 Dec 2025 Warning to people visiting shopping malls in South Africa Poll Do you anticipate a pay hike next year?

With holiday traffic already building, the government has launched extensive safety campaigns aimed at reducing the high number of fatalities typically recorded during the month of December and early January. In Johannesburg, the City’s Public Safety Department has launched its 2025 Festive Season Safety Campaign, which will run from 1 December 2025 to mid-January 2026. The initiative is designed as both a warning and an appeal to road users. With 5.5 million registered vehicles in Gauteng alone, the risk on the province’s highways and streets continues to increase. Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Kedibone Diale-Tlabela said the numbers speak for themselves. There are more cars, more movement, and more people travelling. This means more opportunities for accidents, especially involving pedestrians. She stressed that enforcement will be coordinated and uncompromising, adding that lawbreakers should expect consequences. “All law enforcement agencies are collaborating and working together, and we’ll make sure that people are safe. We will arrest you,” she warned. Pedestrian deaths remain one of the most troubling concerns, accounting for more than half of Gauteng’s road fatalities. This reality has placed additional urgency on the campaign led by MMC for Public Safety Mgcini Tshwaku, JMPD Commissioner Patrick Jaca, and Emergency Management Services Chief Andries Macuvele. Tshwaku said residents should expect high-density patrols and roadblocks across every region, day and night. The City is adopting a zero-tolerance stance on drinking and driving, unroadworthy vehicles, cellphone use while driving, expired discs and licences, and failure to wear seatbelts. Joint operations involving JMPD, EMS, and other enforcement units will be deployed around the clock, supported by thousands of officers. The city will also run 24/7 “smart roadblocks,” where motorists can pay outstanding fines on-site. What they’ll be looking for The national government is echoing these measures. Transport Minister Barbara Creecy has urged all road users to take the surge in traffic seriously ahead of the Christmas and New Year long weekends. She revealed that more than 10,000 people have lost their lives on South Africa’s roads in 2024, with most crashes occurring late at night or in the early hours of the morning—especially over weekends. In response, 24/7 traffic policing will be intensified on high-risk routes throughout the festive season. Officers will focus on speed enforcement, vehicle inspections, and drunk-driving arrests, while border posts will see additional deployments as cross-border traffic increases. Creecy said national, provincial, and municipal authorities, together with the Road Traffic Management Corporation, are working closely to ensure strict enforcement. Historically, the Department of Transport has targeted vehicles with severe defects, and this year the approach will be even tougher. Any vehicle found with three or more critical faults—such as leaking engine oil, defective lights, faulty brakes, worn tyres, cracked windscreens, or expired licences—will be immediately impounded. The City of Johannesburg said its goal is to ensure a “safe, orderly, and enjoyable festive season” for residents and visitors. The Western Cape has also launched its own extensive festive-season plan, unveiled at an event in Beaufort West—one of the province’s busiest transit corridors. More than 600 provincial officers and over 300 patrol vehicles will be deployed across the province. This will be supported by high-visibility patrols, around-the-clock staffing, mobile vehicle-testing units, evidentiary breath-testing centres for alcohol enforcement, and pedestrian safety operations in high-risk areas. Authorities will focus on reducing speeding, distracted driving, reckless behaviour, and driver fatigue on long-distance routes such as the N1, N2, and N7. The Western Cape Government stated that it intends to work tirelessly to keep roads safe and ensure that families can reach their holiday destinations without harm.

Transport Minister Barbara Creecy launched the 365-day Arrive Alive Road Safety Campaign at the beginning of December, and stressed that safer roads rely on the choices made by drivers, passengers and pedestrians. She emphasised that most road crashes in South Africa are not accidents in the true sense of the word—they are preventable and overwhelmingly linked to human behaviour. Creecy urged South Africans to take personal responsibility as the busiest travel period of the year begins. She added that this year marks a meaningful milestone: for the first time in five years, the national road death toll has declined by 700 people. However, South Africa still recorded more than 9,400 fatalities so far this year, a number she described as “much, much too high”. Evidence collected throughout the year shows that human error accounts for nine out of ten accidents, with Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Limpopo responsible for most fatal crashes. Pedestrians remain the most vulnerable group, accounting for more than half of road deaths. For this reason, the campaign will intensify behaviour-change programmes, run extensive public awareness drives, and increase law enforcement visibility, including 24-hour patrols in high-risk corridors. Weekend travel, late-night driving and long stretches where fatigue sets in remain the most dangerous periods on South Africa’s roads. Roadblocks will be stepped up, with authorities focusing on roadworthiness, licenses, seatbelt and child-restraint use, and aggressive action against speeding and drunk driving. The Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) told BusinessTech that it is essential that discussions about dangerous roads are grounded in verified data. Most dangerous roads Official statistics provide the clearest picture of accident trends and high-risk routes, particularly during the festive season when traffic volumes surge. According to the Department of Transport and recent road-safety reports, several national and provincial roads consistently emerge as the country’s most dangerous. The most dangerous roads, as outlined by the AA, are: N1 (Pretoria to Polokwane, Cape Town to Johannesburg) : Heavy traffic volumes and reckless overtaking make this route a hotspot for collisions. N2 (Cape Town to Durban, especially KwaZulu-Natal) : One of the busiest highways in the country, plagued by speeding, drunk driving, and pedestrian activity. N3 (Johannesburg to Durban) : A key holiday route to the coast, often congested with trucks and long-distance buses. N4 (Pretoria to Mpumalanga and Mozambique) : Popular with tourists heading to Kruger National Park and cross-border travellers, with fatigue and speeding as major risks. N12 (Johannesburg to Kimberley) : An alternative to the N1/N3, but long stretches without enforcement make it hazardous. Provincial roads such as the R61 (Eastern Cape) and R71 (Limpopo) : Poor road conditions and mixed traffic (cars, taxis, buses) contribute to high accident rates. Naked Insurance co-founder Ernest North told BusinessTech that its claims data also reflects a small but notable increase in car accident claims in December and January. Long-distance routes linking inland provinces with coastal towns see the biggest spike. This mirrors government data and reflects a familiar pattern: fatigued drivers, heavy holiday traffic, unfamiliar drivers negotiating new routes, and deteriorating road conditions all combine to raise the risks. Urban roads, by contrast, experience more stable accident patterns. As holiday travel picks up, road safety experts and insurers offer several practical guidelines. Drivers should maintain awareness at all times by keeping a safe following distance, scanning mirrors and steering clear of visibly risky drivers. Alcohol and driving should never mix, as even small amounts impair reaction times. Speed limits must be obeyed and adjusted for traffic, weather and potholes. Before any long trip, a basic vehicle check is vital. Fatigue is a silent killer, making scheduled breaks every two hours essential. Overloading vehicles compromises control and braking, while seatbelts—and proper child restraints—remain non-negotiable. Travellers should also plan their routes carefully, avoiding damaged roads, peak congestion and severe weather when possible.

This was revealed in Press Pulse’s latest report, which tracked media sentiment across South Africa’s top business and motoring publications. Ford’s poor media sentiment is not unexpected. Recent developments have raised concerns from owners about safety. In July 2025, Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa announced a recall campaign that affected more than 5,700 vehicles in South Africa. A month later, the company issued another recall campaign affecting over 20,000 vehicles, including the Ranger, EcoSport, and Everest. One of the issues related to the infotainment screen freezing or turning black, which can cause the rear-view camera image to be frozen, missing, or delayed while reversing. Some Ford Ranger models were recalled due to a potential temporary loss of brake boost, requiring increased pedal effort. Soon after the recalls, the company’s South African division announced that it would be retrenching hundreds of workers. Ford explained that these retrenchments were linked to lower European orders for its Ranger pickup truck, driven by recent tax changes in the UK. Media coverage highlighted the concern from trade unions, including Solidarity, and analysts that this move signals structural fragility. Another issue which has been haunting the car brand for many years is the Ford Kuga fire crisis, which made headlines a decade ago. Despite happening so long ago, the Ford Kuga problem continues to be found in articles about the company in 2025. These issues compounded to make Ford the only top car brand in South Africa with a negative media sentiment rating over the last three months. The chart below shows Press Pulse’s media sentiment ranking for Ford, Toyota, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and Suzuki. About Press Pulse Press Pulse developed an artificial intelligence (AI) sentiment-measuring system for online media reports. The system focuses on South African business reporting from top-tier media publications and measures companies’ success in achieving positive exposure. The sentiment ranking is based on the number of positive, neutral, or negative articles and the reach and influence of the publication where they are published. Simply put, the more positive articles a company receives, the better its sentiment ranking. The inverse also holds. Online media in South Africa is highly influential, which is why companies invest heavily in public relations and content marketing to get positive exposure. However, before Press Pulse’s new sentiment system, it was difficult for companies to track their performance accurately. The good news is that new advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to measure media sentiment objectively. The system uses natural language processing and deep learning for accurate sentiment detection. Press Pulse makes it easy for companies to track their online media sentiment and gain insight into how they can improve.

The latest South African Police Service (SAPS) crime statistics recorded 4,533 hijackings in the most recent three-month period. Although this reflects a 15.1% year-on-year decline, the numbers are still worryingly high. The SAPS currently sees about 50 cases of hijackings every day. Using data from police, security companies, and major insurance and tracking firms, MoneyToday published a list of the most stolen cars for 2025. According to MoneyToday, the cars most commonly targeted are: Toyota Hilux Volkswagen Polo Vivo Toyota Fortuner Ford Ranger Hyundai H100 Nissan NP200, Kia Picanto Toyota Corolla Cross Isuzu D-Max BMW 3 Series. Many of these models have appeared on hijacking lists for years. The Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, and Nissan NP200 are popular workhorse vehicles with high resale value, making them consistently attractive to criminals. The Volkswagen Polo Vivo is one of South Africa’s most widely driven cars, and its parts are always in high demand. The Toyota Fortuner has also been a favourite among syndicates because it is easy to resell or strip for components. What is new this year is the appearance of the Kia Picanto, Isuzu D-Max, and Toyota Corolla Cross. Security company Blue Hawk Tactical warned in September that a criminal group had been specifically targeting Corolla Cross vehicles across Gauteng for several months. Wahl Bartmann, CEO of Fidelity Services Group, previously told BusinessTech that criminals prefer cars that “blend in” and can move through traffic without drawing attention. He said vehicles like the Corolla Cross, especially in common colours such as white or silver, are appealing because they are popular and easy to hide among everyday traffic. Once stolen, the cars are either stripped for parts or illegally re-registered and sold. The latest trends and how to avoid becoming a target Since its launch in 2021, the Corolla Cross has become one of the top-selling vehicles in the country, frequently ranking among the top four best-selling cars in 2025. The popularity of these vehicles is a major factor in why they are targeted. Naamsa’s sales data shows that most cars on the list rank among the best-selling models in South Africa. High sales mean high demand for parts, and this creates opportunities for criminal networks involved in chop shops and illegal vehicle sales. MoneyToday noted that vehicles on the most-stolen list typically face higher insurance premiums. Drivers of these cars often pay 15% to 30% more for insurance and may be required to install tracking units or other security devices before their policy is approved. However, while these ten cars are the most frequently targeted, no vehicle is completely safe. The number of hijackings involving a specific model should always be considered alongside how many of those cars are on the road. In other words, a car may appear frequently in hijacking statistics simply because there are many of them in circulation. Bartmann told BusinessTech that overall hijacking numbers have remained relatively stable in recent months. There was a slight decline from August to September, followed by a small increase in October 2025. Looking at past trends, he stressed that hijackings usually rise in November before dropping again in December, and he warned that this pattern might repeat this year. He also reported a new tactic used by criminals. In some areas of the East Rand, such as Tsakane and Boksburg, and the Vaal region, including Vereeniging and Sebokeng, criminals are using hijacked vehicles during house robberies. They load stolen goods like TVs and laptops into the victim’s car, drive to a second location, offload the items into an accomplice’s vehicle, and then abandon the hijacked car. Bartmann urged motorists to remain alert and take simple precautions to reduce their risk. He advised drivers to watch their surroundings closely, especially near intersections, traffic lights, and driveways, and to avoid stopping if they suspect they are being followed. He recommended varying daily routes, keeping valuables out of sight, and leaving space to escape when arriving at home. If confronted by hijackers, he said the safest response is to comply, as resisting increases the risk of harm. Bartmann also suggested carrying a panic device such as Fidelity’s SecureMe or SecureMe Plus, which sends an instant alert to a 24-hour control room in an emergency.

This is especially true for journeys between Johannesburg and major holiday destinations like Cape Town or Durban. An average return trip by car costs approximately R4,217 to Cape Town and R2,185 to Durban. In contrast, average round-trip flight prices for the same routes are significantly higher, at R6,714 and R3,476, respectively. Despite the expected increase in diesel and petrol prices for December, South Africans can expect very simialr prices at the pumps this year compared to December 2024. This makes road travel even more attractive for budget-conscious holidaymakers. For families, the savings become even more pronounced. A car trip costs the same regardless of the number of passengers, making it far more economical for a group of four compared to flying. A family traveling by car would need to spend an extraordinary amount—around R26,000 for Cape Town or R14,000 for Durban on overnight accommodation during the journey—to match the cost of plane tickets for four. BusinessTech looked at the price of a round trip from Johannesburg to Cape Town and Durban with the most popular cars per vehicle type (prices sourced from TopAuto .

The cost of air travel has risen notably, putting additional strain on holiday budgets. Increased operational costs for airlines, such as higher airport fees, maintenance costs, and rising demand during the festive season, have pushed ticket prices higher. Additionally, the demand for air travel spikes during the Christmas period, further driving up prices. Despite the convenience and time savings offered by air travel—especially for those who can afford the higher prices—the financial benefit of driving is hard to ignore. For solo travelers, couples, or families, the significant cost difference makes driving the preferred option. While flying takes only a few hours and eliminates the need for overnight stops, the price gap is difficult to justify for many South Africans, especially during a time when budgets are often stretched. Ultimately, whether traveling solo or with loved ones, South Africans planning their festive season getaways are likely to find driving the more economical choice for Christmas 2025. *Prices sourced from each airline’s website Departing flights were for Saturday, 20 December, while return flights were for Friday, 02 January. Air travel prices are prone to change and not all airlines offer the same packages.

In its results for the year ended 30 September 2025, the group said that it continued its long-term growth trajectory. The group saw group revenue increase by 13.1% to R26.4 billion. Buying and selling volumes of 180,576 and 179,006 units were up 7.7% and 8.4%, respectively. The number of vehicles bought and sold continues to grow, with sales volumes reaching an all-time monthly record of 16,294 units in November 2024. With monthly sales volumes exceeding 15,000 units in six of the last 12 months, the group has continued to gain market share. However, the group acknowledged that it experienced market pressure due to structural shifts within the South African automotive industry. The strength of the new vehicle market and the pricing competitiveness of Chinese brands, including GWM and Cherry, impacted consumer behaviour. “These brands have captured notable market share through attractive pricing and compelling new-vehicle offerings,” said the group. Nevertheless, it said that the buoyant new vehicle market and the growing penetration of Asian brands will be a long-term positive for the group. It said that these vehicles will enter the used-vehicle market in the future. It will also expand the group’s acquisition base and opportunity set. To maintain liquidity and ensure healthy inventory turns, the group adjusted the selling prices for vehicles to compete with asian entrants. “This proactive measure placed short-term pressure on margins during the second half of the year.” Elsewhere, WeBuyCars continued to expand and enhance its national footprint. Two new supermarkets were opened in Rustenburg in October 2024 and Vereeniging in August 2025, adding 300 and 550 parking bays, respectively. The group said that the two supermarkets have delivered pleasing results since opening. It added that upgrading existing facilities also remained a priority, with the Pietermaritzburg supermarket being relocated to a larger site. The facilities at George, Polokwane, Mbombela, the Dome, Riverhorse Valley, Gqeberha and Germiston were also expanded. As of September 2025, the national capacity increased to 12,911 parking bays. The upcoming supermarket openings in Montana (Pretoria North) and Lansdowne (Cape Town) this year will increase total capacity by over 20%. Financials The group said that it continues its long-term growth trajectory with core headline increasing 15.0% to R937.6 million. The key drivers of this growth in core headline earnings were: higher volumes, average selling prices and net insurance result. The rise in earnings was also due to lower finance costs and cost efficiencies driven by economies of scale. The group noted that it issued new shares through 2024, which has an unfavourable impact on basic, headline and core headline earnings per share. The group’s headline earnings per share did, however, increase by over 100% to 937.6 cents per share. The company’s dividend policy is to declare between 25% and 33% of its headline earnings as a dividend, subject to working capital requirements. The group upped its final dividend by 50% to 30 cents per share, with the final dividend reaching 55 cents per share. The company said that it intends to grow its footprint across South Africa responsibly. The Group believes there are opportunities to capitalise on in the short to medium term.

Volvo, which is owned by the Chinese carmaker Geely, will be bringing the new ES90 to the market in the mid-to-late Q1 2026. The ES90 is a sedan that is designed to offer a balance of life, with good safety, technology and versatility. It is the first Volvo car to feature 800-volt technology, enabling a longer range and faster charging than any previous electric Volvo. The car is also designed to evolve over time via continuous software updates. The vehicle was unveiled in March and aims to offer the refined elegance of a sedan with the adaptability of a fastback, as well as the spacious interior and ground clearance of an SUV. The EX60 will follow the ES90 in the mid-to-late third quarter, with the South African market one of the few outside of the EU to receive the model. The new SUV will be revealed in January 2026 and will mark Volvo’s move to make electric luxury more accessible to South Africans. Positioned between XC40 Recharge and the flagship EX90, the EX60 aims to strengthen Volvo’s growing electric SUV portfolio. The new car also promises a far larger range than any previous electric Volvo and an improved user experience. “The upcoming EX60 signals the next chapter in Volvo’s journey toward becoming a fully electric brand,” commented Grant Locke, Managing Director at Volvo Cars South Africa. “As South Africa’s EV landscape continues to expand—with more charging points, growing awareness, and an appetite for premium electrification—the EX60 will arrive at the perfect time.” “It’s designed to bring our latest technology to a broader audience while delivering the range, confidence and everyday practicality that local drivers expect.” While not being new cars, two Volvo cars will have their names changed. The C40 has already been renamed the EC40, and the XC40 Recharge will soon become the EX40. South Africa’s electric vehicle numbers rise The new Volvo ES90 While still behind most of the developed world, South Africa is starting to see increased electric vehicle numbers. The Volvo EX30 has been the best-selling electric vehicle in the nation thus far, with Volvo focusing exclusively on new-energy vehicles. Several other major manufacturers are also offering electric vehicles, including BMW and Mercedes, while new Chinese entrants are also making a splash. GWM recently launched the new electric ORA, while BYD, the largest new-energy vehicle producer, is also expanding its network. BYD has recently launched its BYD Dolphin Surf, which retails for less than R400,000, and aims to bring electric mobility to the mass market. BYD already offers the popular Dolphin hatchback, the Seal sedan, the Sealion SUV and the Shark bakkie. BYD is also investing heavily in infrastructure in South Africa, and is set to bring 300 charging stations to the country, including a new 1MW charging station. The new stations will initially be opened at the carmaker’s dealerships, then expand to the nation’s highways, and finally, to congested urban areas. BYD is also looking to expand its solar coverage across South Africa to ensure greater connectivity, even if this is far smaller than before.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/842518/new-toyota-hilux-revealed-this-is-what-it-will-look-like/,2026-01-18T00:13:00+00:00,,New Toyota Hilux revealed – this is what it will look like,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 10 Nov 2025 Motoring New Toyota Hilux revealed – this is what it will look like Malcolm Libera · 10 Nov 2025 Toyota has officially revealed the next-generation Hilux, confirming one of the most anticipated motoring announcements of the year. The unveiling took place in Thailand, which has become a key production and launch market for Toyota’s pickup range. This new model represents the ninth generation of the Hilux and arrives a full decade after the current version made its debut. The Hilux remains the best-selling vehicle in South Africa and is manufactured locally at Toyota’s Prospecton plant in Durban. The global rollout for the new Hilux is planned for 2026 and covers a broad range of configurations. Among the biggest changes is the introduction of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) variant, which will sit alongside updated internal combustion engine (ICE) models. Engine types and availability, however, will differ depending on the country, so local buyers will need to wait for Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) to confirm the exact lineup and specifications. The new Hilux features a noticeably refreshed exterior while maintaining its familiar, boxy shape, which has become a core part of its identity. On models with traditional engines, the most prominent change is the redesigned honeycomb grille, which takes inspiration from the updated Corolla Cross. Slim LED headlights and LED daytime running lights run across the upper front section, with a black horizontal bar that replaces the traditional Toyota badge with bold “Toyota” lettering. The result is a more modern and assertive appearance that still feels connected to the Hilux heritage. One of the most notable mechanical changes is the introduction of electric power steering, a first for the Hilux. Toyota said this improves steering precision, makes low-speed manoeuvring easier, and reduces steering kickback when driving over rough terrain. The powertrain options announced so far include the well-known 2.8-litre turbo diesel engine, now paired with 48V mild hybrid support to enhance efficiency and responsiveness. The BEV version is likely to draw significant attention once performance and range figures are announced, particularly given the ongoing growth in electric vehicle interest across global markets. Updated interior The cabin sees an even more significant leap in design maturity and quality. Toyota has aligned the new Hilux with the latest Prado SUV, sharing many of the same interior architecture cues. Inside, there is a chunky three-spoke multifunction steering wheel, a push-button start, and a layered dashboard with an octagonal centre frame. This area houses the air vents, hazard function, and physical controls for the climate system, reflecting Toyota’s recent move toward retaining tactile controls instead of going entirely touchscreen-based. Below this section is a slanted panel featuring a USB Type-C port, controls for traction and hill descent management, and a rotary driving mode selector. The centre console features a gear lever that resembles the one in the new Prado, an electronic parking brake switch, and buttons for heated seats. Higher-spec models feature a floating 12.3-inch infotainment display and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, while more affordable workhorse variants are expected to make use of simpler analogue dials and trimmed-back technology solutions. Comfort and safety features include leather seats with eight-way electric adjustment, blind spot monitoring, driver attention monitoring, lane-keep assist, and automatic emergency braking. Details on South African specification levels, drivetrain selection, and pricing will be confirmed closer to its local arrival. Toyota continues to dominate new vehicle sales in South Africa, holding just under a quarter of the total market. The Hilux remains the company’s biggest contributor to this success. Toyota recently reported monthly sales of 3,553 Hilux units, which it says is a new record for the model. The continued demand speaks to its reputation for reliability, local manufacturing support, and suitability across work, leisure, and fleet environments.

On average, around 60 units are sold every day across the country. It has become a familiar sight on the roads and a strong competitor in the compact SUV market, where buyers are looking for affordable vehicles with modern features. In October 2025, the Tiggo 4 range sold 1,725 units, making it the third best-selling passenger vehicle in South Africa for the month. This means it outperformed several long-established brands that have been active in the market for decades. The popularity is not limited to a single month. In the third quarter of 2025, 4,899 units were sold. Monthly sales have stayed steady, with 1,604 units in July, 1,568 in August, and 1,727 in September. The Tiggo 4 range includes 13 different versions, covering entry-level, commercial, and hybrid options. This wide variety means buyers can choose a model that fits their budget without losing essential features. The Tiggo 4 LiT, one of the most popular models in the lineup, starts at R269,900. It offers features such as touchscreen infotainment, safety technology, and a modern interior, making it appealing to buyers who want value for money without paying premium prices. Chery has also introduced a hybrid version, the Tiggo Cross CSH Hybrid. It has become one of the best-selling hybrid vehicles in South Africa, selling 122 units in August 2025. The hybrid is advertised with a fuel consumption of 5.4 litres per 100km and is priced at R439,900, making it the most affordable hybrid currently available in the country. As interest in hybrid and electric vehicles slowly grows in South Africa, this has helped strengthen Chery’s position. Other models in Chery’s lineup are also gaining traction, though at a smaller scale. The Tiggo 9 sold 41 units in September 2025, the Tiggo 8 sold 121 units, and the Tiggo 7 sold 323 units. Massive growth and major plans in South Africa These models show that Chery is expanding into larger and more expensive vehicle categories as the brand becomes more familiar to consumers. The strong sales performance of the Tiggo 4 range has also encouraged Chery to consider building vehicles locally. The company has confirmed that it is conducting feasibility studies to determine whether it should establish a manufacturing plant in South Africa. Chery also owns the Omoda and Jaecoo brands, both of which have also seen growing demand in the country. They are expected to sell more than 11,000 vehicles locally this year. This marks a significant shift from Chery’s earlier experience in South Africa. The company first entered the market in the 2000s but withdrew after struggling with negative perceptions of Chinese vehicle quality. When Chery returned in November 2021, the situation was different. The Tiggo 4 Pro, which launched at the time, was better built and supported by a more organised dealer and service network. Chery expanded quickly. It introduced the Tiggo 8 Pro and Tiggo 7 Pro in early 2022. Within a year and a half, the company had sold more than 5,300 SUVs. Sales doubled from 8,013 vehicles in 2022 to 16,110 in 2023. In October 2024, the company launched the Tiggo Cross, which helped it reach almost 20,000 sales in 2024. For comparison, the brand sold only 1,297 vehicles in 2014. The success of the Tiggo 4 shows how much consumer attitudes have changed. Many South African car buyers are now more open to Chinese brands, especially when the vehicles are affordable and offer a strong list of features.

These include the Audi A4, Jeep Renegade, Fiat Tipo, Maserati Levante, Ghibli and Quattroporte, Jaguar F-Pace, and Lexus RC. Some of these departures mark the end of an era for several long-running models as automakers shift their focus to new technologies, electric vehicles, and changing market dynamics. The Audi A4, which has been around since 1994, is being discontinued and replaced by the new A5 range. The new lineup includes four-door coupés and station wagons, marking the end of one of Audi’s most familiar sedans. The Jeep Renegade is also being cut. Sales dropped sharply in 2024, and it has already been removed from Jeep’s South African website. Jeep said it plans to introduce new models to take its place sometime in the future. Fiat has dropped the Tipo hatchback due to extremely low sales. Only nine Tipos were sold in South Africa in 2024, down from 87 in 2023. Fiat noted that it will now focus on its Panda models and new small SUVs that are expected to launch soon. Luxury brands are also slimming down. Maserati has discontinued production of three models this year—the Ghibli sedan, the Levante SUV, and the Quattroporte luxury sedan. The brand plans to replace them with new electric vehicles in the future. Jaguar is in the middle of its move to become an all-electric brand. It has already ended production of the XE, XF, and F-Type models and stopped making the E-Pace and I-Pace at the end of 2024. The F-Pace SUV continued into 2025, but it will also be discontinued this year and replaced by new electric models. The Lexus RC has also been discontinued in South Africa. The model was last updated in 2019 and was already rare on local roads. Lexus South Africa has confirmed that there are no plans for a new sports car to replace it. These model cuts come at a time when the South African car market has been performing strongly despite affordability pressures. New vehicle sales have grown for 12 consecutive months, and September 2025 saw a 24.3% year-over-year increase to 54,700 units. According to WesBank’s head of marketing and communication, Lebo Gaoaketse, this steady growth reflects improving economic conditions. “A more favourable economic outlook should continue to support increased new vehicle sales,” he said. Stable fuel prices, a stronger rand, and unchanged interest rates are giving consumers more confidence to buy cars again. Still, affordability remains a challenge. “Levels of demand are unprecedented, with September having the highest volumes of applications for finance,” said Gaoaketse. “Ten years ago, with similar sales volumes, WesBank had 28% fewer finance applications, showing how competition for credit has increased.” Passenger car sales rose 28% in September to 38,603 units, while light commercial vehicles climbed nearly 20% to 13,078 units. More buyers are opting for double-cab bakkies instead of sedans, and rental companies also boosted sales with over 8,000 new vehicles bought in September alone. The growing presence of Chinese brands has added even more competition. South Africans can now choose from more than 40 Chinese models, with prices starting at around R269,000 and going up to R1.4 million. Brands like Chery and Suzuki have seen huge growth in recent years. In 2014, they sold a combined 7,699 cars; in 2024, they sold over 76,000—an increase of nearly 900%. This surge, especially from Chery and Suzuki, has changed the market. Many South Africans facing high living costs are choosing these affordable, well-equipped cars over traditional European brands. At the same time, while some are expanding their local offerings, others, such as Audi, Jaguar, and Maserati, are discontinuing older models and preparing for the electric era. The eight cars that have been discontinued in South Africa over the course of 2025 are listed below.

The company, which also owns the Omoda and Jaecoo sister brands, said it is conducting feasibility studies on local production as it looks to deepen its roots in a market that has quickly warmed to Chinese cars. “We’re currently conducting feasibility studies in South Africa, which remains a key focus for both Omoda and Jaecoo,” the company said. “The country plays an important role in our broader global strategy, and we’re carefully assessing opportunities to expand our presence and meet the growing local demand.” The move comes as South Africa’s car market has seen a surge in demand for Chinese brands, with Omoda and Jaecoo expected to sell more than 11,000 vehicles in the country this year alone. Globally, Chinese automakers have been expanding their manufacturing footprints beyond their borders, in part to cushion themselves from possible trade barriers or tariffs on vehicle exports. At the beginning of this month, Tony Lui, the CEO of Chery South Africa, told Reuters that the company is in discussions with several existing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the country about potential partnerships. “We are in discussions with several existing OEMs,” Lui said on the sidelines of an automotive conference. Among the options under consideration are a joint venture with a local manufacturer, building a new “greenfield” facility from scratch, or using another company’s existing production site. One possibility being explored is setting up a complete knocked down (CKD) operation, which is a common approach in the automotive industry where vehicles are assembled locally from imported parts. Lui added that Chery’s initial production focus would likely be the Tiggo 4 compact SUV for the local market, followed by exports to the rest of Africa. Massive growth in South Africa The company also plans to bring in some of its Chinese suppliers to help meet South Africa’s local content requirements. “We are interested in the long-term investment in South Africa,” he said. Chery’s potential manufacturing entry coincides with South Africa’s broader ambitions to expand its automotive sector. The country—already the largest car producer in Africa—launched an Automotive Masterplan in 2021, which aims to increase annual production from around 600,000 vehicles to 1.4 million by 2035. There has also been speculation about whether Mercedes-Benz might allow another automaker to share its East London plant. Outgoing Mercedes-Benz CEO Andreas Brand declined to comment directly but noted that the site had historically produced vehicles for different brands. “In the past, it was reality, and there is technically no reason not to tap into that again,” he said. Chery’s renewed interest in local production represents a dramatic turnaround from its first attempt in South Africa two decades ago. The brand initially entered the market in the 2000s but withdrew after struggling to overcome consumer scepticism about Chinese-made vehicles. That perception has since changed significantly. When Chery re-entered the market in November 2021 with the Tiggo 4 Pro crossover, it quickly gained traction. The company followed with the Tiggo 8 Pro and Tiggo 7 Pro in early 2022, and within 18 months had sold more than 5,300 SUVs locally. Sales continued to surge with the addition of the Tiggo 4 Pro LiT and the Pro Max range, doubling year-on-year from 8,013 units in 2022 to 16,110 in 2023 (a 101% increase). That momentum carried into 2024 with the introduction of the Tiggo Cross in October, further strengthening Chery’s compact SUV lineup. Chery closed the year with 19,971 vehicles sold, representing nearly 24% growth from the previous year—and a remarkable 1,440% increase from the 1,297 vehicles it sold in 2014.

A new team in the Presidency has reportedly already built a working digital driving licence in just three months, although it is still undergoing testing. Once launched, applicants will be able to apply, verify their identity, pay, and store their driving licence entirely through a single mobile app. This would mean no visits to licensing centres, no waiting periods, and no physical card required. The digital licence initiative forms part of a broader push to modernise service delivery in South Africa. The project is being led by the Digital Service Unit (DSU), an organisation created earlier this year to help drive the government’s digital transformation strategy. The unit collaborated with the Department of Transport to develop digital driving licence software using open-source digital public goods, ensuring the system can be scaled and integrated across various government platforms. It will operate through MyMzansi, a new app designed to serve as a single entry point for government services. This move follows growing pressure from civil society and experts who have long argued that South Africa should have transitioned to digital licensing years ago. Road safety expert and Driving.co.za managing director Rob Handfield-Jones has been one of the most vocal advocates for scrapping physical licence cards and discs altogether. He believes digital licensing could resolve many of the long-running issues that plague the country’s licensing system, including backlogs, printer breakdowns, long queues, and widespread administrative delays. Handfield-Jones argued that physical documents are no longer necessary. Each driver already has unique biometric identifiers, and every vehicle has a unique Vehicle Identification Number. He suggested that enforcement officers could simply check a motorist’s information through an app, similarly to how the South African Revenue Service manages tax through digital platforms. No reason why South Africans should still have physical cards He also believes the cost of developing and maintaining the digital system would be significantly lower than what the government currently spends on card printers and the production of plastic cards. However, he has previously expressed doubt that the government would be willing to give up physical cards, claiming that the system generates revenue and may benefit entrenched interests. He said there are no technological or practical barriers to going fully digital and that the real resistance lies in the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s reluctance to move away from analogue document production. South Africa is not alone in exploring digital driving licences. Only a handful of countries, including Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Mexico, and a few US states, have made the transition. Most provide a digital licence stored in an official app, verified through a QR code that enforcement officials can scan. The technology needed for this already exists in South Africa, and the new DSU system demonstrated how it could be integrated. This was demonstrated by the DSU deputy head Richard Gevers, who showed the system could work in South Africa. He demonstrated how motorists’ identities are verified using facial biometrics and how the system directly links to NaTIS, processes payments, and generates a valid digital licence, complete with its own scannable QR code. Instead of needing to complete an eye test at a licensing centre, motorists will be able to visit participating optometrists, who will provide them with a QR code containing their results to upload during the application process. Additionally, the switch to digital licensing could dramatically improve turnaround times. Instead of waiting weeks or months for a card to be printed, a licence could be issued in minutes. It could also ease pressure on licensing centres, which have struggled with backlogs, infrastructure issues, and administrative failures for years.

The group made its official re-entry to the South African market at the end of October, with the brand offering five models to start, including a first-of-its-kind bakkie. The models are: Changang Alsvin (Compact sedan) Changan CS75 Pro (SUV) Changan Hunter Diesel (Bakkie) Changan Hunter REEV (EV Bakkie) Changan Deepal S07 (Luxury EV) Changan is one of China’s four largest automotive groups, with a presence in 70 countries and sales of 2.7 million units in 2024. The group previously offered passenger vehicles in South Africa under the Chang’an brand, which also carried commercial vehicles like vans, light trucks and buses. Larger commercial vehicles were sold under the Chana brand. However, the brand exited the country in 2012. Earlier this year,it was announced that Jameel Motors South Africa would be bringing the brand back, serving as its official distributor.

The new system was supposed to launch on 1 November 2025 and would change how vehicle licences are are issued in the country, with a larger administrative burden for South African motorists. This was a requirement of the National Road Traffic Act. However, the City of Cape Town reached out to authorities to seek clarity on certain aspects. The new system was supposed to require certified identification documentation to be presented at all relevant offices for vehicle licensing transactions However, South Africans are exempt from producing a certified copy of their IDs if they received an SMS for the renewal of their licence from relevant authorities like the Road Traffic Management Corporation. Certified identification documents refer to legible copies of official identification documents. This includes RSA ID Book or ID Card Foreign ID Traffic Register Number (TRN) Certificate However, the City of Cape Town sought clarification on the use of passports and driving licenses as certified identification documents. The relevant documentation was required to be certified as true copies of the original by a Commissioner of Oaths, Notary, or Authorised Official. Certification must comply with the Justices of the Peace Commissioner of Oaths Act of 1963. The certification had to be dated within three months of submission and contain an official stamp and signature of the certifying officer. After having sought clarity on the new national requirements for vehicle registration and licensing, the City of Cape Town was informed that the implementation has been delayed. The city had been informed that the implementation would no longer come into effect on 1 November 2025, with the city continuing to engage the authorities and seek clarity. The city said that following the conclusion of engagements, a new directive will be issued in the new year. Improvements for drives licences Transport Minister Barbara Creecy The vehicle licence update comes amid a significant reduction in driving license card applications in South Africa, which has declined tremendously this year. The Department of Transport previously noted that the number of outstanding licence cards has more than halved in four months. Outstanding licences reduced from 756,227 in May to 336,028 by mid-September. Delays kicked off when the nation’s only licence card printing machine broke down. The machine, which is more than 25 years old, has suffered repeated failures over its lifetime, breaking down over 160 times. These breakdowns result in regular backlogs. The machine was restored in early May, at which point the backlog had grown to more than three-quarters of a million cards. The Driving Licence Card Account started running 24-hour shifts to catch up on the issue, with the Department hoping to bring the backlog to an acceptable level by the year-end. The Department expected the backlog to be fully cleared by December, with the problem resolved by Christmas. The replacement of the printing machine has hit several issues in South Africa, with the Auditor General highlighting irregularities in a tender to acquire a new machine. The tender’s R900 million was far higher than the original budget, with the winning bidder also not meeting technical requirements. Transport Minister Barbara Creecy sought legal action to stop the tender. In the meantime, the Creecy signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Home Affairs to print licences. The Government Printing Works is already producing passports, Smart ID cards, and will now add driving licences.

It is also one step closer to having Home Affairs help with printing cards to bypass the unreliable and old printing machine currently in operation. This marks a major change to the way cards will be made and potecially shorten the waiting time for new cards in the future. Transport Minister Barbara Creecy said the department had received prototype driving licence cards from the Government Printing Works (GPW), which will help speed up production and cut the waiting time for motorists. The GPW already produces the country’s smart ID cards, and its new involvement could mark a turning point in the long-delayed modernisation of South Africa’s licensing system. Creecy said the backlog in the production of driving licence cards has now been reduced to about 200,000 using the department’s old machine, down from around 330,000 in September. “We’ve been working day and night using the existing machine and running three shifts,” she said. The minister also noted that the department’s urgent high court application over the controversial R898 million tender for a new licence card printing system will not be opposed, allowing it to move ahead faster. The legal dispute centres on a tender awarded in 2024 to Idemia Identity and Security South Africa, a subsidiary of the French technology company Idemia. The tender (worth nearly R900 million) was meant to deliver a new card printing system to replace South Africa’s outdated equipment. However, the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) found several irregularities in how the contract was awarded. Following those findings, the DoT filed a case in the Pretoria High Court in July 2025 to have the contract set aside. The court has yet to set a hearing date, but the department’s confirmation that its application will not be opposed removes one major obstacle in resolving the issue. The GPW should become the permanent producer of cards Transport Minister Barbara Creecy The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) played a key role in raising red flags about the tender. After meeting with Creecy, the group submitted a detailed report outlining alleged procurement irregularities. Among its findings were that the contract’s cost had ballooned from the Cabinet-approved R486 million to R899 million—nearly double the initial budget. It also pointed to flaws in the tender adjudication process, including outdated pricing, missing printing material costs, and scoring errors in the evaluation of machines. In response, Creecy asked the Auditor-General to expand the scope of its investigation into OUTA’s claims. The department said it does not want to mediate with Idemia because of unresolved disputes and concerns over the company’s other failed projects in South Africa. This included the Airports Company South Africa’s cancellation of its biometric border control system contract with Idemia. However, department legal adviser Advocate Adam Masombuka warned that cancelling the contract outright could lead to an interdict and a lengthy legal battle that might drag on for years. To avoid further disruptions in licence card production, the DoT has asked the court to allow the Department of Home Affairs, working through the Government Printing Works, to take over printing in the interim. The GPW’s recent delivery of prototype driving cards marks a crucial step in that plan. The DoT has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the GPW to ensure that South Africa has a reliable backup printing solution if the current system fails again. The move has been welcomed by many observers, including the Automobile Association (AA), which has questioned whether the GPW should become the permanent producer of driving licence cards instead of relying on external contractors. In the meantime, motorists waiting for their new cards won’t have to pay extra for temporary licences. DoT spokesperson Collen Msibi confirmed that the department has decided to waive the R72 fee for temporary licences, ensuring that drivers remain legally compliant while delays continue.

The city has increased this number by 196% to 77 in 2025, and officials say this is still not enough. As a result, the city has noted that new high-tech cameras will be gradually introduced, and more officers equipped with manual traps will also be deployed. Speaking with CapeTalk, Alderman JP Smith, the City of Cape Town’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, confirmed that more permanent traffic enforcement cameras are being installed across the city. Smith explained that the 77 cameras erected across the city include both speed and red-light cameras. “It’s probably not enough. We should probably have a significantly larger number if you compare us to other cities around the world,” he said. Commenting on the new speed traps, Smith added that the new cameras being installed are more modern and use technology that makes them less conspicuous. “The cameras are of a slightly more modern design. We’re less likely to see a flash because they use optical systems that don’t require visible flash enhancement. The infrared flash is not visible to the human eye,” he said. Asked whether these cameras actually change driver behaviour, Smith admitted that their impact is limited. “Driver behaviour is changed by a camera only in the immediate vicinity of that camera. People will slow down for the camera and speed up immediately after,” he said. “Cameras are therefore placed where speed needs to be reduced—based on accident data, serious or fatal collisions, or community petitions about congestion or red-light violations.” He added that because fines arrive long after the offence, they don’t have an immediate effect on motorists’ behaviour. “The connection between bad behaviour and punishment is not immediate. So, I don’t think cameras on their own are particularly effective in shaping driver mindset,” Smith said. AI cameras on the cards Because of this, Smith also believes that manual speed enforcement is more effective. “The manual movement of speed cameras around the city is more effective because those locations are not predictable,” he said. He added that they would be most effective and reduce loss of life the greatest if they were concealed, but the public is very earnest that cameras should not be concealed. “You should, of course, never be speeding, so you shouldn’t be worried about where the cameras are,” Smith said. “However, many people spend a vast amount of energy arguing with us about whether cameras are too concealed. Our speed enforcement policy, therefore, emphasises visibility—though I don’t think it necessarily aids road safety.” The City has also been stepping up visible enforcement. “We are slowly but surely deploying more officers,” he said. “We’ve seen a concerning level of contempt for intersections, traffic lights and stop streets. A lot of pedestrian accidents happen within intersections,” he added. “So over the last seven or eight months, we’ve stepped up our enforcement there, and with the new neighbourhood safety officers being deployed, we’re doing more at stop streets and traffic lights.” Many of Cape Town’s cameras now have dual functionality. “They are activated both by speeding and by skipping the red light,” Smith explained. “There are also increasingly effective AI cameras now available, for which we are currently waiting approval from the the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).” “Once approved, they’ll help detect vehicles driving on the shoulder, over solid lines, or committing similar offences.” The City has been testing technology capable of identifying drivers not wearing seatbelts. As for officers filming traffic violations from their vehicles, Smith confirmed this is legal.

The Chinese car brand said that the manufacturing marks a major step in the brand’s long-term commitment to the South African market. The B30 will officially launch in November 2025, with local assembly starting shortly after launch. The company said that the local manufacturing reinforces BAIC’s strategy to build key models on South African soil and expand the plant’s production facility. “Localising the B30 is about more than manufacturing – it’s about investing in people, skills, and a sustainable automotive future for South Africa,” said Ameena Hassan, Brand & PR Manager at BAIC South Africa. “ “Our Coega facility was built to support long-term growth, and the addition of the B30 underscores our confidence in this market and our intention to become a truly local brand.” The R11 billion Coega plan, which was one of the largest industrial investments in South Africa’s automotive sector, currently assembles the BAIC B40 Plus and X55 Plus models. The company said that the new B30 SUV is set to expand capacity and sustain hundreds of local jobs across production, logistics, and dealership networks. The localisation of the B30 strengthens its supply-chain resilience and reduces import dependency. It will also open opportunities for future component sourcing through South African suppliers. “We see South Africa as the gateway to the continent,” Hassan added. “Building the B30 locally allows us to deliver vehicles faster, tailor them to local conditions, and invest directly in the communities that support us.” BAIC’s push into its existing facility comes amid serious challenges facing its European and American competitors in South Africa. Ford Motors is scaling back in South Africa, with close to 500 workers across its plants in Pretoria and Gqeberha being retrenched. Ford’s decision follows a decline in European demand for its vehicles, especially the Ranger pickup, as well as changes in international tax policy that have disrupted its export strategy. BMW is looking to move its locally manufactured vehicles to new markets, particularly Canada, due to the tariffs from the United States. Chinese companies pushing into Africa BAIC’s Coega Facility BAIC is not the only major Chinese automaker increasingly focusing on South Africa. Chery and Haval continue to make a mark in the passenger market due to their affordable prices compared to competitors. Meanwhile, BYD, the world’s largest automaker of new energy vehicles, recently announced a massive infrastructure push in South Africa. Speaking with BusinessTech earlier this month, BYD Vice President Stella Li said the company invests in 300 electric chargers in South Africa, including 1MW chargers. The new stations will start off by being expanded in the group’s dealerships, then expand to the nation’s highways, and finally, to congested downtwon areas. BYD is also looking to expand its solar coverage across South Africa on top of its massive charging expansion. However, Li admitted that BYD is a new player in South Africa, and needs more time before thinking of building a factory in South Africa.

On Tuesday, 28 October 2025, WeBuyCars published a trading statement on the anticipated financial results for the year ended 30 September 2025. It said it was set to report an increase in headline earnings of over 100%, with core headline earnings rising by between 12% and 17%. However, due to the issuance of 83 million new shares in the past financial year, core headline earnings per share are only expected to rise by between 0.8% and 6%. The issuance of these new shares in February, March, and April 2024 also distorts the basic earnings per share and headline earnings per share of the company. These new shares bring the total weighted average number of ordinary shares at 30 September 2025 to 417,401,341, up from 375,029,205 in 2024. It said these new shares were issued in terms of the company’s pre-listing capital raise, which was approved by shareholders prior to the listing of WeBuyCars on the JSE. WeBuyCars said its basic earnings will rise by more than 100% from R343.1 million in 2024 to over R926.8 million when it releases results next month. As a result, basic earnings per share will also rise by more than 100%. The company expects headline earnings per share to more than double. Investors did not like the trading update, and the WeBuyCars share price fell 13.57% on the day. We Buy Cars’ market cap fell from R22.5 billion on the closing price of 27 October to R19.5 billion on the closing price of 28 October 2025. Analyst opinion on WeBuyCars Shane Watkins, chief investment officer at All Weather Capital, explained that investors were expecting earnings of R2.50 per share. When the company reported earnings of R2.14 to R2.15, which was essentially flat, the market reacted negatively. The reason is that WeBuyCars is viewed as a growth stock. “The share is expensive, and expensive shares cannot disappoint,” Watkins explained. He explained that it was not uncommon for the share price of growth companies to plummet by between 10% and 20% when their results are disappointing. Watkins explained that twenty years ago, a share price would fall by a few percent when it released disappointing results. “Today, if the results disappoint in any way, it falls ten to twenty per cent, much higher than previously,” he said. The reason is that the local market has many foreign investors which shoot first and ask questions later. Mark du Toit from Oyster Catcher Investments highlighted that this was only a trading update with very little information. He advised investors to wait for the full results to assess the company’s prospects and see whether it is a good investment. “They had a good first half. The trading update shows that they had a much slower second half,” he said. Watkins added that there is widespread speculation that cheap Chinese cars entering the South African market are putting pressure on WeBuyCars. With the much lower entry point for new cars, which is often cheaper than many used cars, the secondhand car market is taking strain. “Many South Africans may prefer to buy a cheap new Chinese car rather than a secondhand Corolla,” he said.

While pricing has not yet been revealed, the launch marks a notable development for the country’s vehicle landscape, bringing a new type of hybrid technology to one of South Africa’s most popular segments. According to Changan South Africa, the Hunter REEV combines the traditional capability of a bakkie with the efficiency and technology of electric mobility. The model uses a system that blends electric drive with a petrol-powered generator that extends range once the battery runs low. Visually, the Hunter REEV stands out from typical bakkies on South African roads. Changan described its design as “modern, confident, and unmistakably unique,” featuring smooth lines, a redesigned grille, LED headlamps, and 18-inch alloy wheels. The company added that it aimed to create a vehicle that merges toughness with a more refined, futuristic look. Inside, the Hunter REEV departs from the utilitarian interiors common in work-focused pickups. The cabin includes wraparound digital displays, wireless charging, and a 12.3-inch infotainment system. There’s also support for Wi-Fi connectivity and over-the-air updates, meaning software improvements can be installed remotely. “We wanted the interior to feel more like a premium SUV than a workhorse,” said Changan, adding that the vehicle’s design focuses on comfort, ergonomics, and technology. The Hunter REEV is powered by a combination of a 31.2kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery and a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol generator. The battery provides up to 145km of electric-only driving on the CLTC cycle, while the range-extending engine increases the total driving distance to around 1,000km. Combined, the setup delivers 200kW of power and 470Nm of torque through an electric four-wheel-drive system. Changan said the system is designed to give drivers the capability and strength expected from a bakkie, while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. It also allows the Hunter REEV to maintain the towing and off-road functionality that many buyers in South Africa still expect from a pickup. What to exepct Safety and driver assistance features are a key part of the new bakkie. The Hunter REEV includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and a 540° panoramic camera system with parking assist. It also features electronic stability control, traction control, ABS, EBD, trailer sway control, hill-start assist, and hill-descent control. Multiple airbags and brake assist systems add to its safety credentials. “The Hunter REEV is not just powerful—it’s built to protect,” Changan said. For the company, the model represents an attempt to broaden the reach of electrification beyond the passenger car market. “This vehicle shows that electric and hybrid technology can also serve the toughest, hardest-working vehicles on South African roads,” said Changan. All Hunter REEV models will come with a five-year or 150,000km warranty. The company confirmed that introductory pricing will apply at launch, though specific figures are still to be announced. While it remains to be seen how the South African market will respond to the new electric bakkie, Changan believes the Hunter REEV offers a glimpse into how the utility vehicle sector could evolve. “The Hunter REEV is part of a global move toward more sustainable and intelligent vehicles,” the company said. “For South Africans, it’s an opportunity to experience that transition in a way that doesn’t compromise the practicality and endurance they expect from a bakkie.” The Hunter REEV Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

BYD is the world’s largest maker of new energy vehicles (NEVs), with over 1 million staff members worldwide. BYD has sold more cars than its American rival, Tesla, and is starting to gain traction as a new electric car leader, even if many of its sales included hybrids. The company has been steadily expanding its presence in South Africa, launching its Dolphin, Seal, Sealion and Shark models. It has recently launched the BYD Dolphin Surf, which starts at R340,000 and is the first electric car that appeals to the mass market. Speaking to BusinessTech, BYD Executive Vice President Stella Li said the company is looking to massively expand its charging infrastructure in the country. This includes investing 200 to 300 charging stations in 2026 and launching 1MW fast-charging stations. Although a 1MW fast-charging infrastructure will exist in South Africa, Li said that the batteries will only be able to charge at that speed in the near future, with no current BYD cars able to charge at that speed. The new stations will start off by being expanded in the group’s dealerships, then expand to the nation’s highways, and finally, to congested urban areas. The highway network will likely feature charging stations at popular fuel stations nationwide. On top of the fast-charging networks, BYD is also looking to expand its solar coverage across South Africa. This solar coverage will help increase access to electric vehicle charging, but will be at far lower speeds than current chargers allow. Although Li could not confirm the amounts that would be invested in South Africa, she confirmed that the automaker, which has a market cap of around R2 trillion, would invest “a lot” in South Africa. No vehicle manufacturing just yet BYD Executive Vice President Stella Li Despite the increasing global push of BYD into South Africa, the company has no concrete plans to start manufacturing vehicles in South Africa. Li said that BYD is still a very new player in the South African automobile space, and that is still far in the future. This comes despite South Africa’s strong vehicle manufacturing capabilities, access to critical metals, and an increased number of other international players cutting back in South Africa. For instance, Ford recently announced that it would retrench 500 staff members in South Africa, which, despite the US tariffs, the American company said was done in a bid to streamline operations. Li welcomed competition from established automakers in South Africa who are branching out into electric vehicles. One of BYD’s largest competitors in the local market is Volvo, which, despite being a Swedish brand, is actually owned by the Chinese company Geely. Many others, including Mercedes, BMW and Porsche, are also selling electric cars in South Africa, even if uptake still remains far behind developed nations. While BYD is still expanding its market share in South Africa, several other brands, such as Chery and GWM, have quickly established strong sales nationwide. India is also looking set to compete in the local market following the relaunch of Tata Motors. Currently, over one-third of vehicles sold in South Africa are exported from India or China.

This is according to City of Cape Town Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith. He raised the alarm over what he described in an interview with Cape Talk as a growing wave of “hijackings and mafia-style extortion” being carried out by taxi associations across parts of the country. Smith said the City of Cape Town has received several reports of motorists, including those operating private staff transport and scholar transport, being stopped, having their vehicles seized by taxi operators, and then being forced to pay for their release. Smith was blunt in his assessment of what these so-called “impoundments” actually are. He stressed that it is not an impoundment. “It is hijacking when somebody takes your vehicle without your consent and removes that vehicle from your control.” “That is called hijacking, and it’s imperative that people not reward them, not pay them. This is a plain and simple matter of hijacking and extortion—and it is disgraceful.” He added that these incidents are often targeted at vulnerable people, such as workers being transported late at night, or scholar transport operators taking children to school. “Very often it is aimed at quite vulnerable people being taken home from work at difficult shift hours, or scholar transport, which is what it is often aimed at,” he said. Smith said the city’s investigations show that the activity is unequivocally connected to the taxi industry. Vehicles seized in this way are typically taken to taxi rank offices, where the owners are forced to negotiate or pay for their release. “It is done by certain associations explicitly. The vehicles are taken to their rank offices and kept there, and it is to those offices where you go and pay.” The transport mafia He described one operation where the city’s metro police intervened directly. “I was on patrol in Khayelitsha one night when an Uber driver alerted us that this had just happened to him,” Smith said. “We went to the taxi office, found the vehicle there, returned it to the driver, but we also found an illegal firearm hidden behind a cabinet and a lot of cash. They had obviously been taking in fares, but also some extortion throughout the day.” Smith urged anyone affected to contact the city immediately rather than pay the extortionists. “The City is keen to help act on this,” he said. “People can call our call centre on 021 480 7700, and we will assist. We will retrieve that vehicle and arrest the persons for hijacking, but only on condition that the person is willing to open a case.” He explained that victims often decline to open criminal cases, which allows the perpetrators to continue their activities. “What generally happens with these matters is that the persons are not willing to open criminal cases. They want us to recover the vehicle and then just let it be,” he explained. “However, those extortionists just keep on doing what they do. It’s imperative that you’re willing to open a case.” Smith warned that these taxi groups are operating in the same way as other organised crime networks. “We’ve spoken about the construction mafia, so why are we not talking more about the taxi extortion mafia?” he said. “The transport mafia is well covered in research. We are acutely aware of this particular extortion format, because there are roving patrol teams that travel around the city,” he said. “These groups include three or four men in a vehicle, sometimes wearing bibs, making sure only certain vehicles pass certain points.” Smith noted that the city has asked the provincial government to strengthen laws to make these intimidation tactics explicitly illegal. The problem also extends beyond businesses and school transport, with even private motorists being stopped and threatened for giving lifts to friends or relatives. Smith urged motorists to report incidents and hold law enforcement accountable. “Please do call our call centre—we will help,” he said. “But you must also challenge the South African Police Service. Ask them what they are doing about this and how many people they have prosecuted. Because it is seriously out of control.” Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Business Opinion · 1h Big change coming for smoking in South Africa Business · 2h Good news for Discovery medical aid members told to pay back thousands in claims Government · 4h Meet America’s new top official in South Africa Lifestyle · 7h Warning for matrics in South Africa Government · 19h ANC wants to expropriate land without paying for it Property · 21h End of an era for one of South Africa’s most iconic developments Industry News Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa Partner content Codehesion can build a world-class smartphone app for your business in 2026 Partner content Enhancing post-retirement income with discretionary solutions Partner content Standard Bank representative office first to be re-licensed under Ethiopia’s new banking proclamation More News Lifestyle · 23h Gym prices in 2026: Virgin Active vs Planet Fitness Technology · 1d Warning for anyone using WhatsApp in South Africa Business Opinion · 10 Jan 2026 The death spiral South Africa urgently needs to escape Government · 10 Jan 2026 All the bank branches where South Africans can get a Smart ID and passport Government · 9 Jan 2026 Huge problem hitting one of South Africa’s most volatile provinces Business Opinion · 9 Jan 2026 10.5% electricity price hike shock for South Africa Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

According to incoming Mazda Southern Africa CEO Bonite van der Merwe, with so many new options, she believes the market risks “cannibalisation”. This is because too many similar cars are competing against each other, weakening the brands rather than strengthening them. Chinese car brands have quickly become a big part of the South African car market, winning buyers over with affordable prices and modern features. As of May 2025, there are 41 new Chinese passenger models on sale locally, with prices ranging from R269,900 to R1.4 million. For South Africans struggling with high living costs, these cars have been attractive options. However, industry leaders are warning that the surge in Chinese imports comes with some drawbacks. While well-known names like Great Wall Motor (GWM) and Chery have already built good reputations, van der Merwe said newer players still need to prove themselves. She explained that the real test will come when these cars reach the used-car market. South Africans will then see whether the vehicles keep their value or drop sharply in price. She said this depends on the quality of the cars, the cost and availability of parts, and whether manufacturers have a reliable service network to support owners. Van der Merwe warned that without this, buyers could be left with cars that are expensive to maintain and worth very little when they try to sell them. “At the end of the day, the consumer is the one who will be left with the vehicle and the financial burden, if they do not have strong residual values or there are issues with the after-market parts supplies,” she said. This concern is shared by Faan van der Walt, CEO of WeBuyCars, who also urged South Africans to be careful. Governement also considering getting involved He previously said that while many of the new Chinese vehicles look appealing, not all of the brands are likely to survive in the local market. If a company closes or pulls out, its cars will lose resale value, and parts may be hard to find. “It’s fantastic to have a variety of brands available, and we’re getting good value for our money,” he said. “However, just as we’ve seen certain European car manufacturers try to establish themselves here and ultimately fail, I’m certain that some Chinese manufacturers will also give up at some point.” His advice is to stick to established Chinese brands until the newer ones show they can last. On top of these risks, Chinese carmakers could soon face additional problems at home and in South Africa. The South African government is considering higher tariffs on imported vehicles, which would make Chinese cars more expensive. Government subsidies and incentives may also be adjusted to encourage more locally made cars and parts. Trade Minister Parks Tau has already warned that the growing number of cheap imports is hurting South Africa’s own automotive industry, which has been in decline. In China, the government is also cracking down on discounting practices that helped drive sales worldwide. These changes could push up prices for Chinese vehicles, weakening their main advantage in South Africa, which is affordability. The experts have warned that in the short term, South Africans benefit from lower prices and plenty of options. However, in the longer term, questions remain about resale values, after-sales service, and whether all these brands will still be around in a few years.

The rollout marks the brand’s first appearance in South Africa and forms part of Stellantis’ plan to expand its range of electric models globally. Leapmotor was founded in China in 2015 by entrepreneur Jiangming Zhu and sold its first cars in 2019. Since then, the company has sold more than 600,000 vehicles and is now targeting annual sales of 500,000 units from this year. Stellantis, which owns 20% of Leapmotor, will distribute the cars locally through its established dealership network. Stellantis was formed in 2021 from the merger between Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Group. It owns brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Peugeot, Opel, Citroën, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati. Leapmotor will now join this lineup as Stellantis’ first fully electric brand in the country. Mike Whitfield, managing director of Stellantis South Africa, said the local introduction of Leapmotor is part of the group’s strategy to offer new energy vehicle options. “South Africa is a key market for Stellantis, and the launch of Leapmotor marks an important step in offering innovative vehicle options through product, innovation and partnerships,” he said. Leapmotor is focusing on what it calls range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) technology, which combines an electric drivetrain with a small petrol engine that works only to recharge the battery. The engine doesn’t drive the wheels, so the car still operates as a fully electric vehicle. Stellantis said this setup could help overcome one of the biggest challenges for EV adoption in South Africa, which is limited charging infrastructure. “In South Africa, where energy challenges and limited charging infrastructure slow EV adoption, REEV offers a practical solution,” said the company. The first model confirmed for local sale is the Leapmotor C10, a midsize electric SUV that will compete with cars like the VW Tiguan, Toyota RAV4, and Ford Territory. What to expect The C10 will be available in two versions: a battery-electric model (BEV) and a range-extended model (REEV). The battery-electric C10 uses a 160kW motor and offers either a 52.9kWh pack with around 410km of range or a larger 69.9kWh pack with up to 530km of range. The range-extended version includes a 1.5-litre petrol engine with a 50-litre tank, which powers a generator to recharge the battery while driving. It uses a smaller 28.4kWh battery that can provide about 145km of electric driving on its own, but the combined range with the petrol generator reaches around 970km. This extended range could make the REEV version more appealing to South African drivers, especially those outside major cities where public charging stations are still scarce. Stellantis has not yet confirmed local pricing or specifications, which will be announced closer to launch. Inside, the car features a tech-heavy layout that includes heated and ventilated front seats, a large panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, wireless phone charging, and two digital displays, which include a 10.25-inch driver screen and a 14.6-inch infotainment system. The C10’s infotainment system does not support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but it does offer built-in navigation and apps, including Spotify. Leapmotor’s entry into South Africa adds to a growing list of Chinese automakers launching locally over the past two years. However, its connection with Stellantis and its focus on range-extended technology could give it a practical advantage in a market still adjusting to the realities of electric mobility.

This is the message from Barry Berman, Chief Executive Officer of Fines SA, who has warned that from December this year, just around the corner, the new system is set to change the way every motorist deals with traffic fines. “It introduces demerit points, licence suspensions, and stricter penalties for non-payment. With millions of fines issued annually and fraud already on the rise, the stakes for motorists and businesses are high.” According to Berman, the system has been in development for more than 15 years. “The pilot, which has been running in Joburg and Tshwane, has now been fine-tuned. I do believe it’s ready and, yeah, all systems are go for 1 December,” he said. However, Berman explained that the biggest risk is that motorists accustomed to ignoring fines will face serious consequences. There’s been apathy for many years with traffic fines in South Africa. The existing system was launched in 1977, and the payment rates have been quite low. “Motorists are now going to get a very big surprise because what’s happening is that they are going to get these AARTO infringements, which are very quickly going to escalate to enforcement orders, which then mean that they’re going to be blocked on the system,” he warned. Rather than chasing down motorists directly, the government will simply lock them out of essential transactions. “Government is not going to be coming after the motorists. They’re going to be blocking them on the eNATIS system,” he said. “Which then means that the motorists are not going to be able to transact at all, which means buying a car, selling a car, renewing their car licence disk, even renewing their driver’s licence. And then they are going to be forced at that point to pay.” Expect teething problems While concerns remain about whether municipalities can handle the new system, Berman noted that AARTO will run at a national level. Berman explained that the difference with the existing CPA system and the new system is that the new system is going to be a national system, so it’s actually run at a national level. “They have engaged with multiple technology partners who are assisting on the back end. I’m sure there will be some teething problems, but we’re pretty confident that they’ve ironed out most of the glitches,” he said. One of the biggest shifts will come with the demerit points system, although this only fully takes effect in 2026. “You would be surprised how quickly you can hit the limit befor eyour licence is taken away. You can lose a minimum of 1 point per infringement up to a maximum of 6 points,” Berman warned. If you are an unlicensed driver, for example, that is 6 points gone in one go. If your vehicle is unlicensed, that’s another 6 points. “There are quite a few categories where you can lose 6 points in one go, and that’s going to create a major issue for those who depend on driving for their livelihood.” Another emerging problem is fraud and scams linked to fines. “Fraudsters are already circulating so-called ghost fines,” said Berman. “What we are advising motorists to do is to be very cautious before they click on any links from companies that they’ve never heard of or from dodgy email addresses,” said Berman.

The move follows a decline in European demand for its vehicles, particularly the Ranger pickup, as well as changes in international tax policy that have disrupted the automaker’s export strategy. In August, the company issued a formal notice to unions, outlining its intention to lay off 474 employees. This comprised 391 operator roles at its Silverton assembly plant in Pretoria, 73 positions at its Struandale engine facility in Gqeberha, and 10 administrative jobs. The company said the cuts form part of a “realignment” of its production capacity to reflect current and anticipated market conditions. While the announcement coincided with new US tariffs on automotive imports, Ford South Africa clarified that its operations are unaffected by those measures, as the local arm does not export vehicles to the United States. Instead, the group said the retrenchments are a result of a necessary adjustment to optimise production. “We regret that these essential plant adjustments will result in a reduction of positions across both facilities,” Ford said. “We understand the impact this has on our valued employees, and we are committed to supporting those affected. As part of this process, we will be offering voluntary separation options.” Trade union Solidarity, which represents many of the affected workers, has warned that Ford’s retrenchments could be the start of a broader crisis for South Africa’s automotive sector. “We see this announcement as possibly the beginning of greater job losses facing the entire automotive industry in South Africa,” said Willie Venter, deputy general secretary of Solidarity. He added that economic pressures, international uncertainty, and unfavourable local policies are undermining the industry’s competitiveness. The union said it would use the consultation process with Ford to better understand the reasons for what it called a “drastic reduction” in vehicle sales. Reasons for the cut backs Neale Hill, President of Ford Motor Company Africa Ford has since confirmed to Reuters that its South African operations have been hit by reduced European orders for the Ranger pickup, following recent tax changes in the UK, and disappointing demand for its plug-in hybrid Ranger model. The company produces both the internal combustion engine version of the Ranger for local and export markets, as well as the plug-in hybrid exclusively for global exports. However, the hybrid has not achieved the sales volumes the company anticipated, adding further strain on production levels. Neale Hill, President of Ford Motor Company Africa, explained that the business has been forced to reduce its operations from three shifts to two. “In the UK, from the start of April 2025, double-cab pickups with a payload of one tonne or more have been reclassified as passenger cars rather than commercial vans for tax purposes, making them more expensive to own,” he said. “As a consequence of that, people have unfortunately reduced their volume. So that’s had a big impact in terms of our European orders.”Hill noted that the plug-in hybrid Ranger has also underperformed. “We haven’t seen the plug-in hybrid Ranger hit the volumes that we’ve been looking for. It’s an expensive vehicle, plus we are not getting to the European originating content, which then makes it able to go into Europe duty-free.” Despite the setback in export markets, Hill pointed out that South African demand remains stable and is even showing slight growth. Ford’s plant has the capacity to produce 200,000 vehicles annually, but utilisation remains below that threshold. “Currently, this year will be about 100,000, and the installed capacity at capable volume is 140,000. That’s what we’ll keep going forward,” he said.

On 23 September, security group Blue Hawk Tactical reported that a group of hijackers had been targeting Corolla Cross models across the province for several months. The syndicate has been active in areas including the West Rand, Johannesburg, the East Rand, and Johannesburg South. According to the group, intelligence led its operational teams to the East Rand on 22 September, where suspects in a grey Haval Jolion were seen scouting for over an hour before finally stealing a white Corolla Cross outside Kempton Park Court. Blue Hawk Tactical said its teams had anticipated such a move and positioned themselves strategically at exit points. The stolen Corolla Cross was later abandoned and recovered, while the Haval Jolion used as the pilot vehicle was intercepted. Three suspects, including a woman who intelligence had previously identified as a driver of stolen vehicles, were arrested. This is not an isolated case. The Corolla Cross has been climbing the list of most targeted cars in the country since late 2024, when Wahl Bartmann, CEO of Fidelity Group, first raised the alarm. Bartmann explained that hijackers tend to focus on popular and inconspicuous models. Vehicles like the Corolla Cross, particularly in common colours such as white and silver, blend into South African traffic, making them easy to move without drawing attention. Once stolen, these cars are either stripped for parts or illegally re-registered and resold. The model’s soaring popularity has only added to the problem. Launched in 2021, the Corolla Cross quickly established itself as one of South Africa’s best-selling vehicles. By 2024 it ranked as the fourth most popular car sold nationwide, and in 2025 it has surged to second place, just behind the Toyota Hilux. In August alone, 2,743 units were sold , highlighting the demand that is also fuelling its attraction for criminals. No car is entirely safe Security experts, including Bartmann, have warned that hijackings are driven largely by supply-and-demand economics. Cars from Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford remain favourites for hijackers because their parts are widely needed and easy to sell on the black market. The Corolla Cross now belongs to this high-risk group. Anti-theft specialists Ghost South Africa have also highlighted it as one of the country’s most targeted vehicles. While some vehicles are more vulnerable than others, experts have stressed that no car is entirely safe. The broader picture shows that carjackings remain a deeply entrenched problem in South Africa. Although official police data indicates a year-on-year decline in incidents, the numbers are still staggering. The South African Police Service (SAPS) reported 4,533 hijackings in the most recent three-month period, a 15.1% decrease from the same time in 2024. That still means around 50 vehicles are hijacked every single day. The Victims of Crime survey paints an even clearer picture, accounting for incidents that never make it into police records. It found that hijackings had declined from 114,000 to 81,000 year-on-year, a drop of nearly 29%. However, even with this decline, South Africa still recorded an average of 222 hijackings a day. The majority of carjackings occur in South Africa’s most populous provinces. Gauteng alone accounted for 2,488 hijackings in the first quarter of 2025, 55% of the national total. KwaZulu-Natal followed with 583 cases, while the Western Cape reported 536. The reality is that as long as demand for certain vehicles and their parts remains high, hijackers will continue to adapt their focus. Bartmann has emphasised that hijackings can occur at any time and in any location. “Staying alert is probably the most important tip,” he advises. “Too often, we are distracted, which makes us vulnerable to criminal activity. “The best response is to be alert and aware of any suspicious activity near you.” Owners of high-target vehicles should take extra precautions, such as installing advanced tracking devices or avoiding high-risk areas during certain times. Ultimately, the high popularity of certain vehicles translates to their increased likelihood of being hijacked. Comparing the number of vehicles on the road with the corresponding hijacking incidents could offer a clearer picture of criminal preferences. However, as Bartmann underscores, vigilance is essential for everyone, regardless of the make or model of their car.

This critical safety drill, mandated every two years, is carried out in accordance with South African aviation legislation and the standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The exercise forms part of ACSA’s ongoing commitment to the highest levels of public health, safety, and security. The exercise is designed to test and strengthen the airport’s and supporting services’ readiness in the event of an aircraft disaster. It ensures that all systems, protocols, and personnel are fully prepared to respond and effectively manage aircraft or airport incidents. This large-scale simulation will involve multiple stakeholders, including the South African Police Service and the eThekwini Disaster Risk Management Centre. It will also involve the Fire and Rescue Service, the South African National Defence Force, Metro Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Traffic Police, and other critical partners. “Members of the public can expect to see heightened activity in and around the airport precinct during the exercise,” Acsa said. Airports Company South Africa assured the public that this is a planned simulation only and not an actual emergency. “Importantly, normal airport operations will continue without disruption throughout the exercise,” Acsa said.

The company first entered the local market in 2007 but quietly exited in 2014, citing tough economic conditions and strong competition. Now, it has been confirmed that it will be back in October 2025, with dealerships already being signed up across the country. Geely is part of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, one of the world’s biggest automotive companies. The group owns or has stakes in several well-known brands, including Volvo, Polestar, Lotus, and Zeekr. It also co-owns Smart with Mercedes-Benz and holds a nearly 10% stake in the German carmaker. The Chinese manufacturer first entered South Africa in 2007 but exited around 2014, citing tough economic conditions and intense competition. Since then, speculation about its return has surfaced periodically, with trademark filings spotted in 2024 offering the strongest clue. The company has since confirmed that South Africa is on its roadmap alongside major markets such as Brazil and the UK, following its recent launches in Australia and New Zealand. Founded in 1997 in Hangzhou, Geely now operates in 90 countries across five continents, making South Africa part of a much broader international push. In January, Geely opened a facility in Egypt to assemble two of its models, the Emgrand sedan and Coolray SUV, marking its first step into Africa and the Middle East. While it has not confirmed which of its sub-brands will be introduced locally, it has suggested that some, such as Lynk&Co or Zeekr, could follow depending on demand. Globally, the company has been focusing on electric and hybrid cars. In South Africa, however, it will launch a mix of traditional petrol-powered cars and new-energy vehicles, given that the market still relies heavily on both. What to expect According to Geely’s product roadmap, the first models arriving in October 2025 will be the Geely EX5, offered as a battery-electric vehicle and a plug-in hybrid. To support its return, Geely has already signed 35 dealerships in South Africa and aims to reach 40 before its official launch. Gauteng will have the largest number of dealers, followed by KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. The company expects to sell 13,000 cars in 2026, 15,000 in 2027, and 20,000 in 2028, by which time it hopes to have 80 dealerships in operation. South Africa’s automotive industry has taken note. Earle Peters, managing executive at Transnet National Ports Authority’s Durban Terminals, described Geely’s return as a milestone. “It’s encouraging to see major international car brands expanding in South Africa. The return of Geely Motors to South Africa is both a commercial milestone and a signal of confidence in our market and infrastructure.” While the arrival will give South Africans mor echoice, another international brand adds to the pressure facing South Africa’s car industry. Imported cars already make up nearly two-thirds of passenger vehicle sales in the country. In 2024, most of these imports came from India, while Chinese brands accounted for just over 52,000 sales, a noticeable increase from the previous year. Combined Motor Holdings (CMH), which represents major brands including Ford, Jeep, Land Rover, and Mazda, has warned that without stronger government support, rising imports from China and India could lead to job losses in South Africa. BMW Group South Africa CEO Peter van Binsbergen has echoed these concerns, calling the situation an existential crisis for the domestic industry. He stressed that while overall sales have grown, the surge in cheaper imports has undercut local production. Government is aware of the risks. Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau has said that subsidies for locally manufactured vehicles and auto components are under review to encourage higher local content. Tariffs are also being reconsidered to protect domestic producers against the flood of low-cost imports, which he warned is already straining the sector.

The luxury carmaker has exported the C-Class sedan from South Africa to the US since 1997, taking advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which eliminated tariffs on cars imported from the country. That changed when the Trump administration imposed a 30% duty on imports from the nation, upending the economics of the site in the South African city of East London. While options include closing the facility, Mercedes is reluctant to do so after spending about €600 million ($640 million) to modernize the factory in 2022, one of the people said asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. The automaker has also built up a supply chain in the region, and executives value the plant’s 2,400-strong workforce. To avoid costly overcapacity, one option under discussion is bringing in another carmaker to share the facility, the people said. The existing production line could accommodate another brand with relative ease, though the second company would need to set up its own body shop — the part of the factory where vehicle structures are welded, assembled and prepared for painting. Mercedes said it continually assess the competitiveness and sustainability of its plant network. “These evaluations are ongoing and form part of routine strategic discussions within Mercedes-Benz,” a company spokesman said. “No decision has been taken regarding the future of the East London manufacturing plant.” The C-Class is a comparatively low-margin model for Mercedes, especially when measured against the larger S-Class sedan and the high-performance AMG models the company exports from Europe. In the US, Mercedes also builds its larger SUVs in Alabama and is shifting production of the GLC sport utility vehicle to that state, making South Africa’s role in the automaker’s global footprint even more vulnerable. The tariffs are also weighing heavily on Mercedes in the US, a crucial market for its most lucrative models. Unit sales in North America fell 12% in the second quarter of 2025, contributing to a 9% global drop in deliveries, according to a company statement. Exports of Mercedes’ passenger cars from South Africa plunged 48% to 3,950 in August, according to the Automotive Business Council. Introduced during the Clinton administration, AGOA was designed to support the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and improve trade ties with the US. Its suspension has raised fresh concerns about the viability of South Africa’s export-driven auto sector, which counts Mercedes, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG among its largest investors and employers.

This is according to Michael Pashut, founder and CEO of ChangeCars, an online vehicle marketplace for new and used cars in South Africa. Pashut warned that the AARTO Act, when fully implemented, will link outstanding fines to the vehicle owner in a way that directly affects their ability to transfer ownership. The Department of Transport recently published new commencement dates for the AARTO rollout, which will happen in phases between December 2025 and September 2026. Despite the many concerns around the new driving licence laws, Pashut stressed that one of the most significant consequences for motorists will be how AARTO affects car buying and selling. According to Pashut, Traffic fines and demerit points are linked to the vehicle’s owner, not just the driver. “If you try to sell a car with unresolved AARTO infringements, you could be prevented from doing so,” he said. This means sellers will need to ensure all fines are cleared before they can transfer ownership. Businesses will also face new requirements. “Companies must now officially nominate the driver responsible for an infringement, or the company itself will be liable for the fine and demerit points,” Pashut explained. This could create complications for fleet vehicle sales if fines are left unresolved. The introduction of AARTO could reshape driver behaviour, vehicle sales, and even the corporate fleet industry. By linking fines and demerit points directly to ownership, the system ensures that unresolved infringements cannot simply be ignored or passed on to the next owner. “AARTO could put a real spanner in the works for unsafe drivers, from costing them their licences to making it difficult to sell their vehicles,” said Pashut. “Naturally, the easiest way to avoid these consequences is to drive responsibly. It would also be advisable to get familiar with the demerit system and to keep an eye out for infringement notices should there be any.” The official launch timeline Michael Pashut, founder and CEO of ChangeCars The first stage will begin on 1 December 2025 in 69 metros and municipalities, followed by 144 more municipalities from 1 April 2026. The final step, which is the launch of the national driving demerit system, is set for 1 September 2026. While AARTO has been running in Johannesburg and Tshwane for years without the demerit system, the government has long planned to extend it nationwide. The demerit system aims to improve road safety by penalising repeat offenders. “Every driver starts with zero demerit points. When you commit a traffic violation, you get a fine and a set number of demerit points based on the severity of the offence. If you accumulate 15 or more points, your licence will be suspended. If your licence is suspended multiple times, it can be permanently cancelled. Points decrease by one every three months if the driver does not commit further violations. Additionally, fines will be served electronically, through email and other digital channels, not just by registered mail. While some South African drivers have opposed the system, Pashut pointed out that it has been effective elsewhere. “It is a well-tested system, with several countries employing their versions.” He explained that Australia started in the 1960s, New Zealand in 1967, the UK in 1982, and France in 1992. He added that a 2024 study showed that these systems have reduced overall negative outcomes related to traffic by around 21%, fatalities by 10%, and non-fatal injuries by 9%. However, the national rollout has been coming for a long time. Several delays have pushed back the launch, and Pashut said there are still hurdles to clear. The Road Traffic Infringement Agency announced in June that it had begun linking Aarto to the eNatis system and training the country’s 25,000 traffic officers. Additionally, an AARTO Appeals Tribunal must be created before the rollout can commence. RTIA has said that the members’ appointment process is at an advanced stage. However, it remains to be seen whether this process will be completed in time for the project’s launch.

Earlier this month, taxi operators killed one e-hailing driver and injured another two outside Maponya Mall, Soweto. This resulted in a major protest from residents. Speaking with the Sunday Times , Creecy said that the National Land Transport Amendment (NLTA) Act would introduce regulations for e-hailing services like Bolt and Uber, and could help ease rivalry. The legislation, which was assented to by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2024, has been on the books for well over a decade. Under the new legislation, e-hailing drivers will no longer be required to use charter permits and meter taxi operating licences in South Africa. They will receive an official e-hailing operating licence. Each vehicle will also be branded or carry a sign saying it is an e-hailing vehicle. Its operating licence will also lay out the geographical area in which it operates. Creecy said the new system will ensure no oversupply of public transport services. E-hailing drivers will also be vetted and subject to criminal record checks per the new regulations. A professional driving permit will also be required. Vehicles will need panic buttons, and drivers must ensure their profile photo is up-to-date for client identification. Failure to comply with the current regulations could carry a penalty of up to two years in prison or a financial penalty of up to R100,000. Regulators are empowered to withdraw or suspend licences in cases where an operator has contravened the NLTA. Creecy approved the NLTA Act in March. It is currently being translated into a second official language before being gazetted for implementation, which should be in October. Big push for change Transport Minister Barbara Creecy From the outset, a significant push for the NLTA Act was its ability to reduce tensions between metered taxi and ride-hailing drivers. The incident outside Maponya Mall is just one of many incidents where violence between e-hailing drivers and taxis has hit South Africa, particularly in Soweto. The Soweto Taxi Association previously had issues with individuals with no credentials posing as e-hailing drivers to make a commission, which were often at an uncompetitive rate. The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) said implementing the NLTA Act is necessary given the current situation, which has led to a proliferation of unregulated operators in the space. Although Creecy believes the new laws will help reduce violence, she stressed that change was inevitable and coming to the industry. She noted that taxi operators are still part of the modern world, where you either change with the times or don’t survive. She noted that research in the Western Cape showed minibus taxis were best suited for the final leg of a commuter’s journey and not long stretches, where rail was better for communities. The minister said that the department was working with the Western Cape and Gauteng to promote interoperability between the different modes of transport. She noted that Gauteng has been looking for an integrated ticketing system where one ticket can be used for bus, taxi, and train travel.

This is according to UK-based Compare the Market , which is owned by BGL Group. The late South African-born billionaire Douw Steyn owned BGL Group, alongside Auto & General Insurance in South Africa. The Steyn City estate in North Joburg is also named after him. To compile its ranking, Compare the Market conducted a data-led analysis of road safety, traffic conditions and driving environments across 56 global locations. Based on a consistent set of measurable factors, the index is designed to reflect where drivers are most likely and most unlikely to experience safe and supportive road conditions. The comparison looks at five sets of data, including Road deaths per 100,000 people – using historical data, Compare the Market projected the number of road deaths per 100,000 people in 2025 Legal Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) limits Average speed limits across highways, as well as rural and urban roads in kilometres per hour Quality of the roads, on a scale of one to seven Traffic index score, where a higher score reflects more congestion and inefficiency According to this data, South Africa ranks as the fourth-worst country for driving, with an average score of 48.85. A key reason for this was the 17.9 road deaths per 100,000 people, which highlights the country’s challenges in road safety. The country’s traffic score of 186.1 also underscores the need for improvements in traffic management and overall road safety to support a more reliable and secure driving environment. South Africa’s road quality score of 4.5 out of 7 reflects above-average infrastructure, but there is room for improvement to ensure safer and more efficient roads. The nation’s BAC limit of 0.05% is lower than that of other countries on the list, while the average speed limit of 90 km/h is also not terrible compared to its competitors, though remains higher on average. International scores Overall, Compare the Market named Thailand as the worst country to drive in, with a score of 43.83 It has the third-highest rate of road deaths at 30.7 per 100,000 people. The country also suffers from below-average infrastructure. In second place is Argentina, which scored 46.21 due to its poor infrastructure. Indonesia is third due to its high levels of traffic congestion. Regarding the worst statistic, road deaths, Saudi Arabia is comfortably the worst-performer on the list, scoring 53.8. This is followed by Vietman’s 38.5. On the other end of the total rankings is the Netherlands, which had the best score of any country at 84.88. “With well-maintained roads, reasonable average speed limits and relatively low congestion, driving in the Netherlands is a breeze, especially when you’re outside of the city centres,” the group said. “The only thing you need to keep an eye out for is cyclists coming from every direction.” In a close second was Estonia, whose strong infrastructure led to it having the lowest traffic index score on the list. “As one of the least populous European countries, at just 1.3 million people, it’s maybe not surprising that the roads are safer than in busier countries, and its total score out of 100 was 81.93.” Japan and Sweden came in third and fourth, respectively. The nations stood out for their high road quality and low fatalities.

The recall affects thousands of vehicles sold in South Africa between 2018 and 2025. These include the Ford Ranger, Mustang, EcoSport, Everest and custom transit vehicles. The safety recalls mainly revolve around system errors that could impact the infotainment system and camera displays, though there are a few vehicles impacted by mechanical issues as well. It said that the remedies for these problems are expected in the final quarter of the year, and that Ford or authorised dealers will be in communication with owners to resolve them. “Our commitment, together with our dealer partners, is to provide customers with the highest level of service and support,” it said. If customers would like to proactively check if their Ford vehicle is affected by this or any other recall, they can visit www.ford.co.za/owner/recalls/ and enter their VIN number in the search bar. Customers can also contact Customer Relationship Resolution Centre directly at 0860 011 022 / +2712 843 5824 (international callers) or [email protected] in the event that they may have any queries regarding this customer service action. The specific models, and number of vehicles impacted are outlined below: Ford Ranger: Transmission Main Control Valve Body Replacement Ford has commenced a Safety Recall relating to certain 2025 Ford Ranger vehicles. The group identified that in the affected vehicles, the transmission main valve body’s internal dimensions do not meet the engineering print specifications, and the driver may experience no reverse motion when the vehicle is in reverse gear. When the vehicle’s gear selector is in reverse or neutral position, the vehicle may move forward. When this occurs, the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) and Wrench light will illuminate on the instrument cluster in the vehicle. Unexpected vehicle motion can increase the risk of an accident. There are eight of these vehicles affected in South Africa. Ford said it is working to provide parts in order to repair the units. When parts are available, Ford or a Ford authorised dealer will notify the customer to schedule a service appointment for repairs to be completed free of charge. The parts are anticipated to be available by October 2025. Ford Mustang, EcoSport, Ranger and Everest: SYNC Software Update Ford noted that this Safety Recall relates to certain models built between 2018 and 2023. It identified that in the affected vehicles, repeated short ignition cycles (time between key on and key off) may, over time, result in an error in the SYNC system that could result in system instability and/or a failure to maintain certain settings between ignition cycles. This may result in an intermittent blank image while in reverse or rear-view image remaining on display after reverse driving has ended. A frozen rear-view camera display image while in reverse may create a false representation of where the vehicle is relative to its surroundings, increasing the risk of an accident. There are 33 vehicles affected in South Africa. Ford Mustang – South Africa – 30 Ford EcoSport – South Africa – 1 Ford Ranger – South Africa – 1 Ford Everest – South Africa – 1 Ford said it is working to provide a software update in order to repair the concern. The software update is anticipated to be available in the third quarter of 2025. Ford Everest, Ranger and Transit Custom Vehicles: Rear Camera Screen Software Updates The models affected by this recall were built between 2021 and 2025. Ford said it identified that in some of the affected vehicles the infotainment screen may freeze followed by a black screen and a system reboot. If this occurs while reversing the vehicle, the rear-view image may be frozen, missing or delayed. A frozen rear-view camera display image while in reverse may create a false representation of where the vehicle is relative to its surroundings, increasing the risk of an accident. This is the most significant recall of those announced, with 20,693 vehicles affected in South Africa: Ford Ranger – 16,820 Ford Everest – 3,199 Ford Transit Custom – 674 Ford expects the remedy for this error to be available in the third quarter of 2025.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/835226/bad-news-for-driving-licence-cards-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:14:38+00:00,,Bad news for driving licence cards in South Africa,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 17 Aug 2025 Motoring Bad news for driving licence cards in South Africa Malcolm Libera · 17 Aug 2025 The backlog in driving licence cards in South Africa is still hovering around 540,000, and the process of procuring a new driving licence card machine is now on hold owing to a declaratory order application. This has pushed the turnaround time for a new card to around two months, and the delays will continue well into 2026. The transport department told the Sunday Times that 539,947 licences are still waiting to be printed, with many applicants already having to wait months for their cards. The problem continues to be the country’s ageing licence card printing system, which is 26 years old and has become increasingly unreliable. The machine has broken down at least 160 times in its lifetime, with 38 working days lost to breakdowns in 2025 alone. The Department of Transport has already spent R12 million on repairs this year, while an extra R4.4 million has been paid in overtime to keep production running around the clock. To cope with the backlog, the Driving Licence Card Account (DLCA) has been running the machine 24 hours a day with employees working overtime. This has boosted production from the normal 7,440 cards a day to as many as 22,320. However, demand remains higher than output. The DLCA noted that around 10,500 to 11,000 new orders come in every day, meaning the backlog is only shrinking slowly. Over the past three months, the DLCA has managed to catch up at a rate of 2,187 cards a day, but with 539,947 licences still waiting to be printed, it would take over eight months to clear the backlog. This calculation also assumes that the old machine continues running without another major breakdown. If it were to stop working completely, the backlog would grow by more than 300,000 cards every month it is offline. In June 2025, motorists waited four to six weeks. Now they are waiting eight to nine weeks. That is four times longer than the standard two weeks that was previously the norm. To ease some of the frustration, the Department of Transport has waived fees for temporary driving licence cards and suspended penalties for motorists with expired licences. New printing machines dead in the water Transport Minister Barbara Creecy The long-term solution was supposed to come from a plan to modernise the system by introducing new, more secure cards and procuring three new printing machines. Unlike the current system, the new machines would be maintained and repaired in South Africa rather than having to be shipped overseas. But the plan has been delayed by problems in the tender process. The contract for the new machines, worth R900 million, was awarded to a company earlier this year, but was then pulled into an investigation by the Auditor-General over irregularities. Reports in the Sunday Times revealed that a seven-person delegation sent to Europe to inspect the machines visited countries such as France and Amsterdam, even though the machines were not located there. The models they were supposed to examine were in the Czech Republic, Greece, Morocco, and Burkina Faso. Instead, they reportedly inspected an unrelated machine owned by the bidding company. Following the investigation, Transport Minister Barbara Creecy announced that her department had approached the High Court to apply for a declaratory order on the tender. She said the aim was to obtain legal guidance on how to proceed given the Auditor-General’s findings, and ensure no further irregular spending occurred. Until the court provides clarity, the procurement of the new machines is on hold. This has left South Africa stuck with the old, unreliable printer for the foreseeable future. The department initially expected the backlog to be cleared between November 2025 and January 2026. Now it admits that it could take far longer, with delays stretching into the second half of 2026 if demand continues to grow and the current machine experiences further breakdowns.

Domestically, the government is considering higher tariffs on imported vehicles, while in China, authorities are cracking down on the aggressive discount wars that have helped drive sales. Together, these developments could force Chinese carmakers to raise prices, weakening the appeal of their affordable offerings. Speaking at a conference on Wednesday, 11 August, Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Parks Tau, said the government is considering changing subsidies for locally manufactured vehicles and auto components to promote higher local content. Additionally, the state is reviewing tariffs as cheaper cars from China and elsewhere flood the market, undercutting domestic manufacturing. Tau warned that the influx of low-cost imports is straining South Africa’s automotive sector, which has already seen a significant decline. “Decreasing sales of locally produced vehicles, along with new pressures of tariffs, will continue to pressure the auto industry, which has already suffered from job losses and plant closures,” he said. He added that over the past two years, 12 companies have closed and more than 4,000 jobs have been lost in the sector. South Africa’s automotive market, historically dominated by brands like Volkswagen, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz, produced 515,850 vehicles last year, far below the Automotive Masterplan 2035 target of 784,509. At the same time, imports now account for 64% of all vehicle sales, while localisation of manufacturing remains stuck at 39%, far short of the 60% goal. Adding to the pressure is the recently imposed US tariffs, which are cutting into South Africa’s R28.7 billion automotive export market. The industry directly employs 115,000 people, including over 80,000 in component manufacturing, but many of those jobs are at risk as foreign competition intensifies. BMW Group South Africa CEO Peter van Binsbergen highlighted the threat and noted that imports have been eroding the sales of locally manufactured vehicles to the point where the industry faces a potential “existential crisis.” He stressed that while domestic car sales have risen, the value of imports has far outpaced this growth, undermining local production. “We are looking to react to this, and we need to join forces with the government to address it,” Van Binsbergen said. Pressure back home The National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers (NAACAM) CEO Renai Moothilal agreed that the government needs to take more protective measures. He said there is space in the sector to increase tariffs on vehicles and components used in assembly, and pointed to other countries that have acted to shield their industries. He cited Goodyear’s exit from local manufacturing as an example of how cheaper imports can make domestic operations unsustainable. “There is a definite need to relook at our domestic tariffs,” he added. For Chinese car brands, higher South African tariffs would compound the developments unfolding at home. In their home market, Beijing has tightened control over a price war that has helped many Chinese manufacturers gain ground internationally. Authorities are concerned that relentless discounting, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) market, is unsustainable and risks pushing smaller companies into bankruptcy. The Passenger Car Association (PCA) reported that only 17 car models in China had price cuts in July, down from 23 a year earlier. While this marks progress in ending the so-called “involution”, a destructive cycle of hyper-competition, it is also slowing sales. Overall retail car sales in China fell to 1.8 million units in July, down 12% from June. Year-on-year growth slowed to 6.3%, well below the double-digit gains earlier this year. PCA Secretary General Cui Dongshu said the clampdown on price wars will ultimately benefit the industry by encouraging manufacturers to improve quality instead of relying on deep discounts. “Anti-involution is a huge benefit to the industry. Upstream enterprises can instead focus on improving quality, satisfying customer demands and not compete on low pricing,” he said. In early June, the Chinese government summoned major EV makers, including BYD, to Beijing, ordering them to self-regulate and stop offering “unreasonable discounts.” Authorities have also moved against dealer commission schemes linked to auto loans, which allowed dealers to fund discounts from bank kickbacks. The removal of this incentive has further slowed sales. Despite the pullback in price promotions, Cui remains optimistic about the outlook for next year, noting that there may be a rush of buyers before China’s vehicle purchase tax exemption is halved from 10% to 5% in 2025. The combined effect of these developments could be significant for South Africa. If local tariffs rise and Chinese manufacturers are unable to maintain their aggressive pricing due to domestic restrictions, their vehicles could lose the affordability advantage that has made them popular in recent years.

While Tata’s commercial (truck-focused) division, Tata International South Africa, has been in the country since the early 1990s, the passenger vehicle subsidiary exited the market in 2019. The company now plans to relaunch in the local market by introducing a range of hatchbacks, crossovers, and SUVs from August 2025, targeting various segments. Tata has appointed Motus Holdings as the exclusive distributor for its passenger vehicle range. “South Africa is an important market in our global expansion journey,” said Yash Khandelwal, Head of International Business at TMPV. “With our class-leading products and a reputed partner in Motus, we are here to offer our South African customers a choice of safe, stylish, and innovation-driven vehicles.” “We will deliver a distinctive and future-ready mobility experience, backed by attractive pricing, competitive financing, and industry-leading aftersales support.” Tata Motors has a strong presence in India, producing vehicles across multiple categories. All its passenger cars currently hold four or five-star ratings from the Global and Bharat New Car Assessment Programmes (GNCAP and BNCAP). According to the company, its South African range will also feature high safety ratings, with models designed to balance affordability, practicality, and modern features. Khandelwal said the company’s return is not just about selling cars but also about contributing to the local economy through job creation in areas such as sales, servicing, parts distribution, and technical training for local workers. Motus, which will manage the brand’s sales and distribution locally, said the focus would be on offering vehicles that match the needs of South African buyers. “We are excited to launch a brand which embodies an advanced design architecture, cutting-edge technology, and unmatched safety standards across the entire model range,” said Thato Magasa, CEO of Motus Holdings’ TMPV South Africa business. “From advanced safety features and robust build quality to future-focused mobility solutions, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles’ upcoming range is aligned to the needs and realities of the market.” What to expect TMPV is set to unveil its new South African lineup on 19 August 2025, with the vehicles having been rigorously tested for performance and comfort to ensure they meet local expectations. The range will be supported by a well-established dealer network and robust after-sales infrastructure, aiming to deliver what the company calls a “rich and reliable ownership experience” to customers across the country. While full details will only be revealed at the launch, TopAuto pointed to four likely models making their way to local showrooms—the Tata Harrier, Curvv, Punch, and Tiago. The Harrier will be one of the flagship offerings, a midsize SUV powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine producing 125kW. It is expected to compete in the growing SUV segment with a blend of performance, comfort, and safety. The Tata Curvv, a crossover coupe, will offer two engine options: a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol unit with 88kW or a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel producing 85kW. This will provide customers with both petrol and diesel choices in a sporty, coupe-inspired body. For those seeking a smaller SUV, the Punch will be a compact crossover powered by a 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine delivering 64kW and 115Nm. It is expected to appeal to urban drivers looking for practicality, affordability, and modern styling. At the entry level, the Tiago hatchback will likely serve as the brand’s most affordable offering. Equipped with a 1.2-litre petrol engine producing 63kW, it will come with the choice of either a five-speed manual gearbox or an automated manual transmission (AMT).

The company, which makes the Mahindra Pik-Up brand at its assembly plant near Durban, will boost capacity to 1,500 vehicles a month from 900, Rajesh Gupta, chief executive officer of the local unit said. The company is also considering assembling other models locally, he said. Sluggish growth in the continent’s most-industrialized nation has seen South Africans demand more economical cars. Sales of Mahindra, Suzuki and China’s Chery have jumped, while those of Mercedes-Benz and BMW plunged or stagnated. In 2014, luxury brands such as Audi, BMW, Mini, and Mercedes-Benz collectively sold around 74,015 vehicles in South Africa. As of the end of 2024, this number had dropped to 23,881. This translates to a 68% drop in sales—highlighting the stagging amount of South Africans who no longer see these vehicles as an option. The biggest loser was Mercedes-Benz, dropping 82% to 5,048 sold units in 2024 from 28,99 in 2014. This was followed by Audi (-70%) and then BMW and Mini (-50%). In contrast, vehicles from Asia—such as Chery, Haval, and Suzuki—have seen massive growth over the same period. The average selling price of cars has dropped 2.3% in the two years to 2025 to R490,478, according to Toyota, South Africa’s most popular auto brand. Annual inflation averaged about 4.5% over the same period. The pick-ups assembled in Mahindra’s Durban plant, which opened in 2018, have become popular with local farmers. They’re also used by the police in neighboring Mozambique. The company also sells other sports utility vehicles in South Africa including the XUV 3XO, XUV 700, Scorpio-N and Bolero. Mahindra’s expansion is a rare bit of good news for President Cyril Ramaphosa as his government struggles to reduce the fallout from US President Donald Trump’s 30% tariffs, with the auto and agricultural exports exposed to the biggest hit. The rise in the mid-market segment has even lured Tata Motors. India’s largest auto maker by sales has tied up with Motus Holdings to distribute its vehicles in the African nation, according to the South African car retailer. Stellantis NV — the maker of Alfa Romeo and Jeep — is also building a plant in the country to make pick-ups. Mercedes, which last year produced 70,000 cars in its plant in East London — about 650 kilometers south of Durban — cut a shift and announced it would fire 700 workers last year, even before Trump’s tariffs decimated US demand. Mahindra — the owner of Automobili Pininfarina, the handcrafter of €2.2 million electric hypercars — also plans to bring EVs to South Africa, according to Gupta. “We are extremely sure of bringing them sooner than later,” he said, without providing a timeline. The company will offer both the BE 6 & XEV 9e EV lines to South African consumers, he said. The Mumbai-based company is considering upgrading the plant to assemble vehicles using completely-knocked down parts from a semi-knocked assembly plant, Gupta said. The expansion has created about 100 direct jobs.

This follows claims from Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng spokesperson for community safety, Michael Sun, who alleged that officers told the party they are under pressure to meet this target. Sun added that the party was told by officers that if they met the daily fine targets, they would be offered overtime payments. This encouraged them to focus on issuing fines rather than on bylaw enforcement, traffic management, and crime prevention. Sun argued that the tactic would shift the focus of policing from public safety to revenue collection. The DA said it it believes this is contributing to increased roadblocks across the city, especially at busy intersections. It said many of these are labelled as “roadside checks” to avoid stricter legal requirements set out in the National Road Traffic Act and SAPS Standing Orders. These requirements include authorisation from a senior officer, proper signage, and adequate warning to motorists. Sun argued that without these safeguards, such operations are not aimed at improving road safety or traffic flow but at collecting fines from motorists. The DA called on Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi to step in, remove any revenue-based policing targets, and ensure that JMPD officers focus on their core duties. It also submitted questions to Premier Lesufi asking for clarity on the legality of these instructions, the roadblocks, and the use of public resources. However, following the allegations, the JMPD denied the claims , saying that no quotas are in place. The JMPD emphasised that its primary mission is to maintain safety and order on the city’s roads, rather than to generate revenue. JMPD spokesperson Xolani Fihla stated that traffic fines are issued based on observed infractions, not to meet any revenue targets. “It is important to clarify that while issuing citations is a necessary part of enforcing traffic regulations, there is no quota system that officers are required to follow,” he explained. “The department’s focus is on ensuring compliance with traffic laws to prevent accidents and protect the lives of all road users, not on generating a specific number of traffic fines.” Fihla added that the performance of officers is assessed based on their overall effectiveness in creating a safer environment for the community, including the issuance of citations, rather than by a predetermined target for fines. “The integrity of our operations is paramount, and all actions are carried out in strict accordance with the law.” Action is needed now The allegations of pressuring traffic officers to collect more revenue come as the City of Johannesburg faces a severe financial crisis. The Auditor-General has flagged over R22 billion in irregular expenditure and hundreds of millions in wasteful spending. National Treasury has warned that funding to the city could be cut if no action is taken, and Mayor Dada Morero has been given 14 days to respond. Julius Kleynhans, Executive Manager for Local Government at the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), said the city’s financial troubles are largely due to a lack of accountability. “Over a year ago, we saw a billion rand taken back by Treasury from conditional grants that were unspent. When those in charge don’t spend allocated money, they should be held to account,” he said. “Over the last five years, Johannesburg has been a target for looting, and when no action is taken against those responsible, it raises questions about whether leaders are involved.” Kleynhans said the city needs stronger oversight from council, competent administration free from political interference, and performance measures that promote service delivery and economic growth. “Last year, the city received R7.12 billion for free basic services, yet it cannot account for the households that benefited. The same goes for infrastructure grants. Residents can see the money hasn’t been used effectively,” he said. While Mayor Morero has launched a “bomb squad” to speed up service delivery, Kleynhans believes this will have little impact without changes in leadership. “If the mayor were serious, those who failed to do their jobs would have been removed already. Instead, new layers are being added above ineffective staff,” he said. Kleynhans warned that Johannesburg is close to a collapse in governance, pointing out that the city has already passed unfunded budgets, which he said is illegal. He called for properly qualified councillors, stronger accountability measures, and more independence in oversight roles like the municipal public accounts committee. Despite the problems, he believes there are many skilled and committed municipal employees who could help the city function well if given the right leadership. “If we had competent leaders in place, the system could work, but the political issues must stop,” he said. With the city now under pressure to present a plan to curb wasteful expenditure, Kleynhans said real action is needed. “We’ve seen enough plans on paper. Unless the lack of consequence management is addressed, the city will not turn itself around. Only when people are held accountable for poor performance or misuse of funds will we see change.” BusinessTech asked the City of Joburg to comment on the reported traffic fines instruction and will add it once it is received.

Those impacted by the application backlog also need to provide valid proof. During a recent operation in the Cape Town CBD, city tariff officers recorded 164 transgressions, 54 of which were motorists who could not provide a driver’s licence. The city warned that motorists must always carry their original driving licence while operating a vehicle. Photocopies or digital images are not considered a valid substitute. If you are a licensed driver but do not have your original licence with you, you can be fined R500. If the card has been lost or stolen, proof of the new application should be kept on hand in case you are stopped. This also applies to drivers who have applied for a new licence card but could not get it due to the printing machine delays earlier in the year. These drivers either have to have a valid temporary licence on hand or proof of the application. “It’s quite alarming to realise how many people are driving without valid licences, or proof of a valid licence,” said Cape Town MMC for Safety JP Smith. “It might seem of little consequence, but the fact is, officers are duty-bound to enforce the law.” Smith said the city is facing massive challenges with unlicensed drivers who are a danger to themselves and others. “Presentation of that driving licence card is the only way to prove that you are behind the wheel legally.” Printing delays Transport Minister Barbara Creecy The licence card warning comes as the transport department and Driving Licence Card Account (DLCA) deal with a backlog of applications. The backlog accrued while the country’s only card printing machine was out of service earlier in the year. The department has urged South Africans who have applied for new licence cards to keep their proof of application with them, which can be used as validation while the backlog is being dealt with. Responding to a parliamentary Q&A in June, the department said that the backlog of cards that need to be printed is sitting at 733,000 cards. This was, however, an improvement of 14,500 since the start of May, since the driving licence machine returned to service following a breakdown in February. Civil action group Outa said the printer can only process between 14,000 and 19,000 cards in a 14-hour shift. Thus, clearing that backlog would take 40 to 53 days, excluding adding any new card applications. South Africa’s printing machine has seen at least 160 breakdowns over its 26-year lifespan, with breakdowns becoming more frequent with age. The country’s plan to acquire new printing machines has also been placed on ice, pending a declatory order for the courts. The country has attempted to overhaul its licensing regime by adding new, updated, more secure cards with additional printers. The new machines would also be maintained and repaired in South Africa, unlike the older machines that needed to be shipped overseas for repairs. That said, the tender process has not gone well, with a R900 million contract awarded to a company only to be pulled into an Auditor General (AGSA) investigation over irregularities. Transport Minister Barbara Creecy filed papers at the Pretoria High Court in mid-July, requesting that the contract for new driving licence printers be set aside and the tender process re-run. As an interim solution, the department is turning to the Department of Home Affairs’ Government Printing Works (GPW) for assistance.

This is the message from Elijah Uhuru Lekgowane, President of NEFSA, who has confirmed that a national e-hailing strike is imminent. This comes shortly after e-hailing drivers in Johannesburg said they were planning a shutdown this month to protest ongoing issues such as Uber’s commission percentages and unprofitable fares. Drivers warned that people who use services like Uber and Bolt in Johannesburg should organise alternative transport. Drivers have reportedly said the strike will continue until their grievances are heard and their pricing demands are met. Prices and commissions on e-hailing platforms have been a long-standing issue, with drivers organising regular protests for higher pay. Now, drivers across the country are preparing to protest against what they describe as exploitative conditions and unfair treatment by e-hailing companies and the government. E-hailing services form a huge part of the transport landscape in and around our cities. They’ve become a key way to move, whether shopping, visiting friends, or getting home safely after a night out. Lekgowane explained that more and more South Africans are turning to these services because buying and maintaining a vehicle is simply unaffordable. However, despite their growing importance, e-hailing drivers say they are being pushed to the brink. “We’ve seen a 35% slashing of fares since 2016, and now drivers are being deactivated without due process,” Lekgowane said. “On top of that, the platforms are phasing out vehicles older than five years, even if drivers still owe money to the banks on those cars. It’s completely unreasonable.” According to Lekgowane, NEFSA has been organising behind-the-scenes coordination of this action at a national level, which marks a shift from past protests. “Previously, provinces and regions would protest on their own. This time, we are consolidating our efforts nationally. The mother of all protest actions is about to hit the country—sooner rather than later. ” Drivers can’t continue under the current circumstances He added that NEFSA’s demands are clear and urgent. “We’re calling for a restructuring of the pricing index. That’s central,” he said. “We’re also demanding an immediate stop to the deactivation and harassment of our drivers, especially when they go on strike.” “Some of our members have already received emails threatening them with deactivation just for participating in a legal protest.” Another critical issue is the forced phasing out of vehicles from the platforms. Lekgowane said the policy must stop immediately. Many of our drivers are still locked into financial agreements for these vehicles. NEFSA is also directing strong criticism at the South African government. “Our government seems to be conniving and conspiring with these companies,” Lekgowane said. Asked when the strike will take place, Lekgowane said a national coordinating committee meeting is scheduled to take place soon. “We’re bringing all the provinces together to plan the action. At the moment, we can’t say the strike will happen tomorrow, but what I can guarantee is that national action is coming,” he said. “Right now, we are running a charity and can’t afford it anymore. We are saying to the app companies: if we can’t make earnings, you can’t make a profit. It’s as simple as that.” Lekgowane stressed the real-life impact of the current conditions on drivers. “You see drivers sleeping in their cars at 02h00, waiting for work, so that they can put food on the table. This has become a major problem.

In 2025, more than 70% of all the cars in South Africa now cost more than R500,000. One key reason for this spike concerns the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw car factories around the world shut down and lay off workers when lockdown restrictions were enforced, and the demand for cars dropped. After the easing of restrictions, consumer spending quickly rebounded, while production was slower to return to pre-Covid levels. This created a supply-and-demand problem, leading to inflation. In South Africa, the poor performance of the local economy and the rand/US dollar exchange rate have magnified this effect, making it exponentially more expensive to import and sell vehicles here. To reflect the magnitude of vehicle price increases, BusinessTech looked at the prices of an Audi A1, BMW 1-Series, and Mercedes-Benz A-Class in 2015 compared to today in 2025 and how much you would need to afford them in their respective time periods. In 2015, an A1 1-Series, and a A-Class cost R265,000, R342,000, and R389,200, respectively. According to financing experts, individuals should spend no more than 25% of their monthly income on vehicle-related costs, which means they would require an estimated salary of between R23,000 per month for the A1 and up to R35,000 per month for the A-Class. This assumes the cars are financed over five years (60 months) at an annual interest rate of 10.75%, with a 0% deposit or balloon payment. Fast-forward to 2025, and the vehicles now cost R530,900, R713,395, and R813,124, respectively. All three have doubled in price, which means that to afford the same cars, one must increase their salary by up to R36,658 per month. To put this into perspective, the entry-level VW Polo is now R373,800, which is only R15,400 or 4% less than the Mercedes-Benz A-Class back in 2015. Car Starting price 2015 Starting price 2025 Change Mercedes-Benz A-Class R389,200 R813,124 +R423,924 (109%) BMW 1-Series R342,000 R713,395 +R371,395 (109%) Audi A1 R265,000 R530,900 +R265,900 (100%) Car Income 2015 (pm) Income 2025 (pm) Change Mercedes-Benz A-Class R34,035 R70,693 +R36,658 pm BMW 1-Series R29,954 R62,069 +R32,115 pm Audi A1 R23,295 R46,288 +R22,993 pm The increase in the cost of this Mercedes-Benz vehicle is more than double the inflation rate over the same period (66.1%), showing the rapid and unsustainable increases in car prices over the past decade. What’s worse is that salaries have just kept up with inflation since 2015. According to Stats SA, the average formally employed non-agricultural worker in 2014 earned an average of R17,387 per month, which has increased to R28,231 per month in 2025, representing an increase of 62%. This massive increase in prices is one of the several reasons why premium European car brands have seen a notable drop in sales over the same period, as outlined by the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). Sales for Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW have more than halved in the last decade, with total sales declining from 74,015 at the end of 2014 to 23,881 at the end of 2024—a concerning 68% decline. The biggest loser was Mercedes-Benz, dropping 82% to 5,048 sold units in 2024 from 28,993. This was followed by Audi (-70%) and then BMW and Mini (-50%).

The recall spans the Ford Ranger, Everest, Puma, and EcoSport models, all built between 2021 and 2025. The most recent notice involves the popular Ford Ranger and Everest vehicles fitted with 3.0L V6 engines and manufactured between June 2022 and March 2025. FMCSA has identified a possible fault with the left-side camshaft sprocket, which may fracture and lead to an engine stall. “An engine stall without warning increases the risk of an accident,” said Ford. 1,050 vehicles across Southern Africa are affected, 995 in South Africa, and the remainder in Botswana, Namibia, and Swaziland. The recall includes 571 Ranger units (534 in South Africa) and 479 Everest models (461 in South Africa), which all require inspection and repairs. In a separate safety campaign, Ford has also recalled nearly 1,800 Ford Puma vehicles manufactured between November 2021 and September 2024. According to the company, the concern involves a fuel line that may rub against a bracket, leading to damage over time. “This potential issue may result in an engine stall or, in the presence of an ignition source, a fire,” the automaker warned. Ford warned owners to watch out for include a strong fuel smell, visible fuel leaks under the car, or smoke caused by fuel contact with hot surfaces. Most of the affected Pumas—1,775 of the 1,796 units—are in South Africa. The recall also extended to the Ford EcoSport, specifically models produced between April 2021 and July 2022. FMCSA discovered that the front half shafts may not have been fully inserted into the transmission during assembly in some units. This defect could cause the half shaft to disengage, potentially resulting in a sudden loss of engine power or the car rolling away if left in “Park” without the parking brake applied. These scenarios, Ford noted, increase the risk of an accident. A total of 2,872 EcoSport units are impacted, with 2,806 located in South Africa. Ford has begun reaching out to affected customers and urged owners to contact their preferred dealers to arrange inspections and repairs. “The dealer will inspect the vehicle and carry out the necessary repairs,” the company assured, adding that all work will be performed at no cost to the customer. “Our commitment, together with our dealer partners, is to provide customers with the highest level of service and support,” said FMCSA. To check if a specific vehicle is affected by any of these recalls, Ford owners can visit www.ford.co.za/owner/recalls and enter their VIN number. Customers can also contact Ford’s Customer Relationship Resolution Centre on 0860 011 022 (or +27 12 843 5824 for international calls), or via email at [email protected] for further assistance.

The Limpopo-Gauteng Speed Train Project, which aims to connect Pretoria to Polokwane, is gradually moving forward. First announced in 2023, the project has now entered a critical stage, with feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments underway as of mid-2025. These studies are necessary to ensure the project is safe, economically viable, and environmentally sound. Led by the national Department of Transport, along with the Gauteng and Limpopo provincial governments and private investors, the project’s development is focused on securing funding and finalising the technical groundwork. One of the key challenges the government identified is land acquisition along the planned route. However, successful negotiations with communities and landowners would allow for the railway’s construction to move forward. If all goes to plan, construction is expected to begin in late 2026, with the first trains running by 2030. Once completed, the bullet train will significantly reduce travel time between the two provinces. The current five-to-six-hour car journey from Pretoria to Polokwane would shrink to just 90 minutes by rail. The 500km route will include multiple stops along its path, extending beyond Polokwane. Planned stations include Hammanskraal, Bela-Bela, Mokopane, Louis Trichardt, and Musina. The first phase will cover the Pretoria-to-Polokwane stretch, while the second phase will handle the route’s expansion to these other key locations. The train is expected to travel at an average speed of approximately 177 km/h between Pretoria and Polokwane, and exceed 200 km/h on specific segments. While not matching the speeds of the fastest international high-speed rail (HSR) systems, the train will still technically qualify as a bullet train under global definitions. This project forms part of South Africa’s broader rail infrastructure ambitions. Gauteng has already committed R120 billion towards expanding its rail network over the next five years, which includes adding six new areas and increasing the Gautrain’s network from 80km to 230km. The Limpopo-Gauteng line will run alongside this expansion. Plans struggle to leave the drawing board Transport Minister Barbara Creecy Transport Minister Barbara Creecy has said that revitalising South Africa’s transport sector, particularly rail, is a top priority. The government has set targets that include increasing Transnet’s annual rail freight from 149 million to 250 million tonnes and restoring PRASA’s commuter network to handle 600 million passenger journeys annually by 2030. However, despite these plans, South Africans have seen multiple promises around rail and public transport development over the years, with many plans struggling to leave the drawing board. The high-speed rail framework, for instance, was first discussed as far back as 2010 under former transport minister Sibusiso Ndebele. President Ramaphosa reiterated the idea in his 2019 State of the Nation Address, imagining bullet trains running from Johannesburg to Musina, with further connections to cities like Buffalo City and eThekwini. In 2022, then-transport minister Fikile Mbalula gazetted a National Rail Policy White Paper that formally introduced high-speed rail corridors as a key development objective. This policy was approved by Cabinet in November 2023, and in his 2024 State of the Nation Address, Ramaphosa confirmed the government would now prioritise feasibility studies. These studies are for key routes, including Johannesburg to Durban, Johannesburg to Polokwane and Musina, and Johannesburg to Mbombela. While the Limpopo-Gauteng Speed Train is a significant part of these plans, the Johannesburg-Durban line has been identified as particularly strategic due to its potential to compete with airlines on that route. Cost estimates for that line alone hover around $30 billion (R530 billion) , raising serious questions about funding. The government has insisted it would fully fund the Limpopo-Gauteng project, but with South Africa’s fiscal constraints, external support will be crucial. Private investors and foreign partners like China, who have expressed interest in investing in the Johannesburg-Durban line, are expected to play a role.

According to Neale Hill, President of Ford Motor Company, Africa, the move is a strong vote of confidence in the brand’s long-term strategy, products, and customer experience in the country. “While some brands may be consolidating or rationalising, Ford is evolving its dealer business to meet the needs of modern customers,” said Hill. Hill noted that Ford’s approach centres on right-sizing dealerships, enhancing aftersales infrastructure, improving digital readiness, and optimising locations to meet the expectations of today’s time-strapped and tech-savvy customer. “That’s not us saying we believe in Ford. That’s our partners endorsing it – a clear vote of confidence in our direction, our people, and, most importantly, our products and our belief in our customers.” Currently, Ford has 118 strategically located dealerships across South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Eswatini, making it one of the top three largest networks in South Africa. The aim is to grow the network, improve the overall customer experience, and future-proof the brand amid shifting market dynamics. In 2024 alone, 20 new dealership projects and facility upgrades are either underway or set to begin. These investments are already generating indirect economic activity across the country. The broader network supports over 10,000 direct jobs in South Africa. Ford’s data suggests that these upgraded facilities improve customer satisfaction and boost business performance. Hill pointed to Ford’s 2023–2024 Global Retail Assessment study, which found that dealerships aligned with Ford’s global design standards consistently outperformed those that hadn’t been upgraded, particularly on customer-facing metrics. At the heart of Ford’s success in South Africa is its best-selling Ranger Double Cab, which remains a top performer in both local and export markets. Ford South Africa still sees growth The Ford Ranger is currently South Africa’s leading double cab and was the first bakkie to be named SA Car of the Year in 2023. The Ranger Raptor, another standout in Ford’s line-up, was recently named the “Ultimate Double Cab Bakkie” at the 2025 Cars.co.za Awards. In the first half of the year, 236,914 new Ford vehicles were sold through dealerships in South Africa, accounting for over 85% of all new vehicle sales. This figure represents a 12.9% year-on-year increase, closely tracking the wider market’s 13.6% growth. Ford also climbed to fourth place overall in June. It captured 6.5% of the new vehicle market, a 0.5 percentage point increase. What makes this achievement particularly notable is that Ford’s growth was driven mainly by Ranger volumes in a market otherwise dominated by passenger car sales. Apart from the bricks-and-mortar expansion, Ford noted the upgrade that includes personalised finance solutions, dedicated aftersales support, and consistent service across the dealer network. “It’s really about the service, support, and relationships we maintain throughout the customer journey. That’s what creates real brand connection and lasting trust,” Hill added. Flagship sites like the multi-franchise Paarden Eiland dealership in the Western Cape exemplify Ford’s strategy in action, combining dealer diversification, strategic brand alignment, and an enhanced customer experience. Together, Ford and its dealer network are positioning the brand for growth, relevance, and resilience in a competitive and rapidly evolving automotive landscape. “We’re building momentum, not just in terms of sales but in trust, customer loyalty, and long-term confidence in the Ford brand,” said Hill.

It also includes AI functionality used by our internal teams.” “Blue is a collection of machine learning models that hold our pricing and vehicle information, based on historical data, purchase and sale history, and market trends.” These AI models are updated weekly and used to guide decision-making, particularly pricing, which is essential in the vehicle trade business. Since late 2022, AI has become more mainstream, mainly due to the introduction of tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. WeBuyCars said the technology is already being put to use. “ Blue has bought just over 2,800 cars autonomously, without any human pricing involved. We’re scaling that up as we go ,” Beukes said. These systems are designed to handle repetitive and high-volume tasks efficiently. Beukes explained that agentic AI is able to break a job down into smaller steps, plan how to do it, and work through those steps without human intervention. The shift to AI is the latest development in WeBuyCars’ digital overhaul. The company began over two decades ago as a small operation run by brothers Dirk and Faan van der Walt. In the early days, most processes were manual. When Beukes joined the business 17 years in, even core functions such as inventory, sales, and finances were still being run through basic spreadsheets. “Everything was managed on a Google Sheet. And they sold over 2,000 vehicles this way a month. But it had reached breaking point. We couldn’t just throw more people at the problem. We knew we had to digitalise,” said Beukes. The next step He noted that at the time, the company faced a choice: adopt a standard enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or build its own. “2,000 cars is a lot of stock to manage, and it’s difficult to do that on a Google Sheet. We decided to build our own software from the ground up.” That decision laid the groundwork for the system that runs the business today. It manages all aspects of the company’s operations, from sales and pricing to customer leads and marketing. WeBuyCars now operates 17 large vehicle showrooms, known as “vehicle supermarkets”, and nearly 100 smaller “buying pods” across the country. Because it controls its own software and data, the company is able to test new ideas and features quickly. The company’s marketing division also plays a large role in feeding the AI systems. Beukes said the business generates many of its sales and purchase leads through its website and social media platforms. AI helps process those leads, allowing human staff to focus on the more unusual or complex cases. “If we can automate a certain percentage of our lead or buy-lead management, we can handle more leads with the same number of people,” explained Beukes. “Then we let the humans focus on the edge cases.” Not all vehicles are suitable for automated pricing, however. “There’s no reason a human has to price a Polo Vivo, because the volumes are so high. But in fringe cases, like a 1974 Mercedes-Benz, that’s difficult to price. It needs human understanding.” Beukes noted that the company isn’t aiming for full automation, but rather for a system where technology handles the bulk of routine tasks and human expertise is reserved for where it’s most needed. He said AI is simply the next step in making the business more efficient, scalable, and responsive to customers.

This is according to Santam Client Solutions CEO Atang Matebesi, who flagged that criminals are opting to hijack vehicles rather than steal them while unattended, posing new risks for drivers across the country. According to the South African Police Service’s (SAPS) latest quarterly crime statistics, hijackings decreased by 15.1% between January and March 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. However, with 4,533 hijackings recorded in just three months, equating to about 50 vehicles a day, the number remains disturbingly high. The insurer’s 2025 Insurance Barometer highlighted that 50% of surveyed consumers cited crime, including hijacking, as a top personal risk, second only to the rising cost of living. “The data reflects what we hear from clients every day. People are afraid, whether they’re driving to work, collecting their children, or stopping at the shops,” said Matebesi. One of the most concerning developments is that hijacking is increasingly replacing traditional vehicle theft. Criminals are now more likely to confront motorists directly rather than target parked vehicles. “Hijacking gives criminals immediate access to the vehicle and its contents without having to bypass modern security features. It’s quick and direct, and unfortunately, often violent,” explained Matebesi. Tracker’s crime data also supports this shift, particularly in high-risk provinces like Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Eastern Cape. The Eastern Cape emerged as a notable concern, with an 8:1 ratio of hijackings to theft, indicating that hijacking is now the dominant crime in that region. Urban areas like Midrand, Honeydew, and Roodepoort have recorded the highest number of incidents this year. “We’re not saying people should let their guard down during other times, but it’s worth noting that most hijackings occur on Friday evenings between 16h00 and 21h00,” Matebesi said. He added that this pattern highlights the importance of being extra cautious at the end of the work week, especially during peak traffic hours. Motorists need to take precautions Atang Matebesi, CEO of Santam Client Solutions “It’s encouraging to see the numbers trending down, but hijacking and theft are still far too common,” said Matebesi. “What’s important is that we’re now seeing what works, particularly when it comes to proactive interventions like enhanced tracking systems in high-risk vehicles.” Considering the trends, Matebesi said that one of the most effective deterrents currently available is the use of multiple tracking systems. Santam’s claims data shows that vehicles equipped with two separate tracking devices experience significantly lower hijacking and theft losses. “If one device is tampered with, the second may still be functioning, increasing the chances of recovery,” said Matebesi. “These underwriting interventions are making a measurable difference. Fitting a dual tracking system doesn’t guarantee that your vehicle won’t be targeted, but it significantly increases the chances of recovery.” Matebesi also stressed the importance of proper insurance coverage in a climate where vehicle-related crime remains high. “It’s about protecting yourself financially against the ripple effects of a loss. It all adds up, from car hire costs and excess payments to debt obligations if the vehicle is financed.” In many cases, hijacking claims go beyond the vehicle itself. They may include property damage, trauma counselling, or even legal expenses. “Having proper cover in place is not a luxury, it’s a necessity,” Matebesi warned. For those who can’t afford comprehensive insurance, he recommends exploring alternatives such as Third Party, Fire and Theft cover. It’s more affordable and still covers you if your car is hijacked or stolen. Matebesi also suggested parking in secure, well-lit areas, especially overnight, as this can also reduce risk.

The commission is urging all affected consumers to act quickly to avoid possible injury or harm linked to potentially life-threatening faults in the affected vehicles. Jaguar Land Rover Limited has recalled specific Range Rover Evoque models manufactured between 2021 and 2024, along with some 2025 units. The NCC noted that the passenger airbag may have been improperly folded during the assembly process. This defect could result in the airbag tearing upon deployment. According to the NCC, a torn airbag might reduce protection during a collision and allow hot gases to escape, increasing the risk of burns to occupants. “These are basic, life-critical flaws,” said Prudence Moilwa, Head of Complaints and Investigations at the NCC. “By the manufacturers’ own admission, something went wrong in the production process, and that’s why these recalls are happening.” Additionally, Mercedes-Benz South Africa has initiated a recall of several 2023 models, including the SL (232), EQS (297), GLC (254), S-Class (223), and C-Class (206). The company identified a problem with the vehicles’ fuse boxes, which may not have been reworked as required. This could lead to serious malfunctions, including power failure, impaired instrument clusters, or failure of critical restraint systems, significantly increasing the risk of an accident. The NCC has also warned that the possibility of a thermal event, such as a fire, cannot be ruled out. Moilwa confirmed that both the airbag and fuse box issues present significant safety concerns. “We’re talking about improperly folded airbags that can tear and electrical faults that could cause cars to lose power or even catch fire,” she said. She noted that this kind of failure should not happen, especially not in high-end vehicles like these. “Manufacturers must invest more in research, development, and quality control to avoid these defects and the high costs associated with recalling and repairing vehicles.” Consumers must take the recall seriously Prudence Moilwa, Head of Complaints and Investigations While the manufacturers have taken steps to alert vehicle owners, Moilwa said that not all consumers are responding appropriately. “We are monitoring these recalls and are aware that in some instances, suppliers have informed consumers, but they are not bringing in their vehicles. “This is a safety-critical recall, and consumers need to understand the urgency,” she said. The NCC has reiterated that under Section 61 of the Consumer Protection Act, manufacturers are liable for any harm caused by their products, regardless of whether a consumer ignores a recall notice. Acting NCC Commissioner Hardin Ratshisusu has also urged vehicle owners to take action immediately. “Affected consumers are urged to immediately contact any nearest authorised dealership of these motor vehicles to have the defect repaired at no charge,” he said. Moilwa emphasised that the recall process is simple and hassle-free. “It’s similar to taking your car in for a regular service,” she explained. “The parts are already available. You simply need to book your vehicle at the dealership, and the repairs are done for free.” “Depending on the dealership’s service policies, you might be dropped off at your destination or given a courtesy vehicle.” Moilwa also reassured the public that product recalls are standard international practice and supported by South African law. “Product recalls are legal under the Consumer Protection Act and are common in all countries. They are meant to allow suppliers to mitigate risk before something goes wrong.” The NCC has not yet confirmed the number of vehicles affected, but Moilwa urged all motorists with Range Rover or Mercedes-Benz models from the specified years to check their vehicles. “We urge consumers to check whether their vehicle is affected by entering the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) on the manufacturer’s website, calling the helpline, or contacting a dealership. The VIN is the most important identifier,” she said. Moilwa warned all vehicle owners not to dismiss the recall simply because their cars appear to function normally. “This is about safety,” she said. “Taking your vehicle in might feel inconvenient, but it’s nothing compared to the risks of driving a car with a potentially deadly defect.” Media-Statement-Range-Rover-and-Mercedes-Benz Download Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Property · 3h New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Finance · 4h Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 5h New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 7h World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 8h Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 9h End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Property · 11h Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses 5 Things · 11h One of South Africa’s richest families receives over R1 billion in Capitec shares, and blow for DStv owner Business · 12h Storm brewing over Mr Price deal to buy European retailer for R9.7 billion Government · 21h United States releases alarming statement about South Africa Business · 1d Township shopping mall to be sold for R177 million in South Africa Lifestyle · 15 Jan 2026 South Africans can now visit 101 countries visa-free in 2026 – losing access to 5 destinations Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

Chery South Africa confirmed that it is currently in the second phase of a feasibility study to determine the viability of local manufacturing. “Given Chery’s rapid growth in the South African market, we have reached a critical sales volume that justifies exploring local production,” said Neel Hariram, Chery SA’s strategic planning and government relations director. He explained that the feasibility study is evaluating several production models, including semi-knocked-down (SKD) and completely knocked-down (CKD) kits, contract manufacturing, joint ventures, or a greenfield investment. “All potential models are under review as part of this study,” he noted. Hariram said that Chery SA is currently focusing on assessing the capability of local suppliers and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. “While we cannot provide an exact timeline at this stage, we anticipate progress in the near future as we advance through the feasibility phases,” he said. However, he highlighted that local production would enhance cost efficiency, reduce import dependencies and strengthen our market positioning. Hariram also said Chery has already begun discussions with the South African government regarding its plans and aims to deepen its engagement as the study progresses. The move could be closely linked to Chery’s earlier announcement of a new research and development (R&D) centre planned for South Africa. When the company announced the plan earlier this year, it hinted that it could lead to a full-scale manufacturing facility. Although Chery first entered the South African market in the 2000s, the brand struggled to gain traction due to consumer scepticism towards Chinese vehicles and soon withdrew. However, sentiment has shifted considerably in recent years. Chery made a strong return in November 2021 with the launch of its Tiggo 4 Pro crossover, followed by the Tiggo 8 Pro and Tiggo 7 Pro in early 2022. Massive growth in South Africa By April 2023, 18 months after its re-entry, Chery had sold 5,389 SUVs in South Africa. The brand’s momentum continued to build with the release of additional models like the Tiggo 4 Pro LiT and the Tiggo 7 and 8 Pro Max variants. These new offerings helped Chery double its vehicle sales in 2023 compared to 2022, growing from 8,013 units to 16,110, a 101% year-on-year increase, the highest the company had achieved at the time. That trend continued into 2024 with the launch of the Tiggo Cross in October, a range-topping alternative to the Tiggo 4 and a complement to the Tiggo 7. By the third financial quarter of 2024, Chery reported an 18.29% increase in quarterly sales, rising from 4,113 to 4,941 units. The Tiggo 4 Pro alone recorded a remarkable 30.67% spike in interest during that period. The company ended 2024 with 19,971 units sold in South Africa, an increase of nearly 24% over the previous year and a staggering 1,440% growth from the 1,297 units it sold in 2014. As Chery continues to expand, it is also preparing to launch a new brand in South Africa called Lepas. The new car was first unveiled at the 2025 Chery Global Business Conference in China and is expected to debut locally in 2026. While an exact launch date has not been set, Chery has already appointed a national brand and marketing manager to oversee Lepas’ rollout in South Africa. “Chery remains committed to sustainable growth in South Africa and the broader African market,” said Hariram.

This is according to Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) spokesperson Monde Mkalipi, who outlined the agency’s plan for implementing the new traffic enforcement regime. The first phase of the rollout begins on 1 December 2025, when AARTO will be introduced in 69 municipalities, including major metros like Cape Town and Johannesburg. “Most of the metros are included as part of the initial rollout,” said Mkalipi. The agency will expand coverage in two additional waves, one in February and another in April 2026, to include the remaining municipalities. The RTIA and the Department of Transport believe the AARTO system is necessary to tackle the human behaviours behind most road crashes in the country. “Research has shown that more than 80% of road crashes are due to human error and thus call for behaviour-changing efforts on our part,” said the Deputy Minister of Transport, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, in his budget vote speech. He described AARTO as central to the demerit system that systematically aims to contain road user behaviour. Although the AARTO rollout begins in December 2025, the points demerit system, often seen as the heart of the reform, will only be activated from 1 September 2026. This system will allocate demerit points for traffic infringements, leading to licence suspensions or cancellations if drivers accumulate too many points. Learner drivers can only accumulate up to six points before facing a three-month suspension, while fully licensed drivers face suspension at fifteen points. From December 2025, drivers will initially engage with AARTO’s “elective options,” previously tested in Johannesburg and Tshwane. “If you receive a traffic infringement, you’ll be expected to resolve it within 32 days and can benefit from a 50% discount,” Mkalipi explained. For those who miss the 32-day deadline, alternatives include submitting a representation to dispute the fine, nominating another driver, redirecting the infringement, or paying in instalments. “These five elective options are key features of the system. We will explain these to road users so they know exactly how to respond to infringements,” he said. AARTO rollout impractical Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) spokesperson Monde Mkalipi Mkalipi warned that non-compliance will carry serious consequences. “If you violate traffic laws and don’t act, your driving licence or vehicle licence disc may be blocked from being renewed,” he said. This includes holders of public driving permits, who will also need to act quickly to avoid penalties. A key objective of the new system is to bring consistency across the country’s fragmented traffic enforcement landscape. “Currently, the system is fragmented. Cape Town has its own bylaws, which might differ from those of Johannesburg or Tshwane. AARTO brings uniformity,” Mkalipi explained. The system will also digitise traffic law enforcement to combat corruption. “Currently, most parts of the country use handwritten infringement notices,” Mkalipi said. “With AARTO, we are moving to electronic devices. When a violation is captured, it is immediately loaded onto a handheld gadget and fed into the system. This will reduce human interference and help eliminate bribery.” Some municipalities have already begun piloting these systems, and RTIA hopes to phase out paper-based fines entirely. Infringements will eventually be delivered via email and other electronic channels. While the government has promoted AARTO as a game-changer, some civil society groups are not convinced. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) has previously raised serious concerns , calling the rollout impractical and an administrative burden. “It does not address the root causes of accidents, the risk of corruption, and administrative cumbersomeness,” OUTA said. Municipal buy-in is another major challenge. OUTA questioned whether all 245 municipalities and seven metros could realistically be ready for AARTO. The Automobile Association (AA) echoed these concerns. “We stand by our previous views that the AARTO legislation is geared towards revenue collection and not on promoting safer roads,” it said. “Introducing legislation will not solve the country’s road safety crisis. This merely creates an impression of action while nothing will change on the ground.” The AA further noted that there’s no evidence the AARTO pilot in Johannesburg and Tshwane saved any lives. Despite these criticisms, Mkalipi said the RTIA is committed to public education and ensuring the system brings real safety benefits. “We are hoping that, with the new system, we can reduce fatalities and promote accountability on the roads,” he said.

This is according to Thembinkosi Pantsi, Vice Chairperson of the National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA), who warned that these businesses are under siege in South Africa. “Smaller independent dealers are under severe pressure in terms of the margin squeeze that we’re seeing in the industry. Customer footfall is not where we’d like it to be, and overheads remain high.” According to Pantsi, these pressures are compounded by South Africa’s sluggish economy, which continues to weigh heavily on businesses that don’t have the same buffers and support structures as larger dealer groups. Unlike their corporate counterparts, independent dealerships lack the financial reserves, JSE listings, and access to low-cost funding that help bigger players weather tough economic conditions. “Cash flow is critically important for independent dealers. And when sales dip or margins tighten, that becomes a very real problem,” said Pantsi. While May 2025 brought some much-needed relief with new vehicle sales increasing by 22%, Pantsi said this improvement must be seen in context. He pointed out that the overall trend over the past few years has been downward, particularly in new car sales. One of the industry’s biggest changes is how consumers buy cars. Pantsi noted that the traditional in-dealership experience, where buyers walk in, explore models, sit in the cars, and speak to sales reps, is fading. “People no longer walk into dealerships. They do their research online. They know exactly what they want, sometimes right down to the specs and price, before they even engage with a dealer,” he said. Platforms like AutoTrader and WeBuyCars have capitalised on this digital shift and, according to Pantsi, pose a real challenge for smaller dealers. “The larger players with deeper pockets have gone aggressively into technology and the e-buying of cars,” he said. “Independent dealers are having to respond by embracing online platforms and technology-driven solutions to stay relevant.” Adapt or die Thembinkosi Pantsi, Vice Chairperson of the National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) . Another disruptor in the market is the entry of Chinese car manufacturers, which Pantsi said are changing the game entirely. “The Chinese brands have really shaken up the local market,” he said. “For consumers, they offer an excellent value proposition that’s hard to ignore. “And you’re now seeing them setting up shop right next to luxury brands like Land Rover and Jaguar in the richest parts of Johannesburg.” While cheaper new vehicles are a threat to small dealerships, there’s also a potential upside for them. Some Chinese brands, Pantsi explained, are more open to working with smaller dealers and even support multi-franchise models, where one dealer can offer multiple brands under one roof. “That’s something we’re already starting to see, and it could help diversify revenue streams,” he said. Despite the challenges, Pantsi believes this is also a time of opportunity. “This is an exciting time. It stretches our capabilities and forces us to innovate. Dealers are starting to build what we call ‘dealers of the future’,” he said. Pantsi pointed to international examples like the UK, where some companies have adopted car vending machines. “You go, insert a token, and your car is delivered to you with no human interaction. That’s the kind of innovation we’re not ruling out in South Africa.” But alongside technological innovation comes the need for workforce transformation. As electric vehicles become more common, the demand for traditional mechanics is expected to drop. “EVs don’t have engines in the traditional sense. We won’t need as many traditional technicians but more people with electrical and tech skills. The jobs won’t vanish; they’ll just change.” Pantsi added that the sector will need to keep evolving. “The automotive industry contributes nearly 6% to South Africa’s GDP,” he said. “It’s too important to fail. But we must adapt. That means embracing technology, reskilling the workforce, and finding new ways to serve a changing customer.” Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Business Opinion · 29m Eskom holding South Africa hostage Government · 2h Ramaphosa sends a warning to the ANC Government · 2h New state of disaster on the cards for South Africa Business Opinion · 3h In contemplation of Sapiens – the species and the book 5 Things · 3h Prime interest rate ‘cartel’ investigation in South Africa, and South African retail giant in hot water Business · 4h Jobs in South Africa that don’t need experience or qualifications Industry News Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software More News Lifestyle · 18h Unique South African school achieves 100% university exemption and 4.4 distinctions per student Energy · 19h South Africans to pay for R76 billion mistake Government · 20h Dark times ahead for an important South African industry Finance · 21h Tax return warning for over 500,000 taxpayers in South Africa Business · 22h R17 billion boost for South African-born billionaire since the start of 2026 Government · 24h Europe gives South Africa the green light Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

New energy vehicles run on energy sources that are not exclusively petrol or diesel. They are designed to reduce emissions and lessen the environmental impact of transport. In South Africa, where fuel prices are high and pollution is becoming a growing concern, these new energy vehicles can offer a cleaner and cost-effective transport alternative. Although South Africa’s adoption rate is low compared to developed nations, momentum is building as battery costs drop, renewable energy expands, and policies begin to support greener transport. Investec highlighted the three main types of new energy vehicles that all use different technologies to lower emissions: Electric vehicles: These run entirely on electricity. They have lower running costs but can be more expensive upfront and may have limited driving range depending on the model. In South Africa, EV adoption is growing steadily and is expected to continue increasing. Hybrid electric vehicles: These combine a petrol engine with a small electric motor, offering flexibility in fuel use. However, their complexity means maintenance costs can be higher due to more moving parts. Plug-in hybrids: These serve as a bridge for those transitioning to electric vehicles. They can run on electric power for shorter trips but still use petrol for longer journeys, offering the best of both worlds. Electric vehicles, which are not reliant on petrol or diesel like hybrids, have a driving experience that differs from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Driving an electric car means users must embrace new habits of carefully planning long-range charging stops. However, during daily urban driving, charging can be done conveniently at home, making the process somewhat easier. EVs also don’t require frequent visits to fuel stations, reducing stress and saving time. The instant torque in electric vehicles also makes them enjoyable to drive. Longer trips require some planning around charging points as efficiency drops at higher speeds, but EVs are still primarily designed for urban driving. “Overall, once drivers understand and accept these differences, electric vehicles quickly become the preferred choice, especially for city commutes and regular use,” said Investec. Owning an electric vehicle doesn’t just offer strong performance from the get-go, but can also have lower running and maintenance costs over time. Charging at home keeps the charging costs lower, particularly when using off-peak tariffs. When using solar power, the price can drop to near zero. Public charging can cost between R1.50 and R3.50 per kWh, depending on the station and available charging options. EV batteries also typically last eight to 10 years, and even longer with proper care. Battery replacement costs are around R100,000 but are expected to decrease with technological advancements. Big initial outlay The Volvo Ex30 is the best-selling EV in South Africa, and is the fastest Volvo ever built Although maintenance and service costs will often be cheaper for EVs, they still require a hefty initial outlay compared to their ICE counterparts. This can be seen with brands that offer the same model in both ICE and EV versions, which reveal significant cost differences. For instance, the electric Mini Countryman SE costs over R1 million, while its ICE counterparts start from just over R700,000. The cost of upgrading from an ICE car to a hybrid one is cheaper, with the increase in price for the newly launched Chery Tiggo Cross R40,000 more expensive. South Africa is reducing EV import duties, which could lead to greater uptake. However, electric vehicles still have a long way to go before they are affordable for the average South African. The breakdown below highlights the difference between the same model of car across different energy sources: Chery Tiggo Cross Hybrid Version – Starts from R399,900 ICE Version – Starts from R439,900 Difference – R40,000 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid Version – Starts from R414,800 ICE Version – Starts from R494,400 Difference – R79,600 Mini Cooper Electric Version – Starts from R802,000.00 ICE Version – Starts from R595,000.00 Difference – R208,000 Volvo XC40 Electric Version- Starts from R1,108,000 Hybrid Version – Starts from R842,300 Difference – R266,000 Mini Countryman Electric Version – Starts from R1,086,000.00 ICE Version – Starts from R717,600.00 Difference – R350,400 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

Buying a car in South Africa has become significantly more expensive over the past decade, with the overall cost of ownership costing R1,705 more per month than it should. A new study by WesBank highlighted the growing financial pressure on consumers, as many feel the pinch when affording and maintaining a vehicle. South Africa has experienced a constant influx of new vehicles on the market, with more variety than ever. However, this growing selection doesn’t ease the financial burden. According to Lebo Gaoaketse, Head of Marketing and Communication at WesBank, despite the recent improvement in passenger car sales, South Africa remains a price sensitive market. He stressed that buyers tend to focus heavily on the sticker price when in reality, they should consider the full cost of ownership before making a purchase. To help buyers better understand the real financial commitment of owning a car, WesBank calculated the monthly costs of one of the country’s best-selling hatchbacks, currently retailing for around R294,000 including VAT. “Based on this, buyers can expect a monthly instalment of approximately R5,554.80,” WesBank said. This figure is influenced by the interest rate on the vehicle finance contract, which depends on the buyer’s credit profile and loan term. However, the purchase price and monthly instalment are only part of the equation. Comprehensive insurance, which is mandatory for financed vehicles and strongly recommended even for those bought outright, adds another layer of cost. Insurance premiums vary widely, but WesBank estimated a monthly insurance bill of about R1,827.24 for the car in question. Fuel also remains one of the most significant and ongoing costs. Even with recent price relief at the pumps, WesBank calculated an average monthly fuel spend of R3,902.50 for this hatchback, based on typical usage patterns. On top of this, routine maintenance and running costs contribute an estimated R475.75 each month, or about R5,709 annually, for general upkeep. Above inflation increases When all these expenses are added together, including the instalment, insurance, fuel, and maintenance, the total cost of owning this vehicle will be around R11,760.29 per month in 2025. This is slightly higher than the average monthly ownership cost in 2024, which was R11,578.70. Looking back over the past decade, the sharp rise in ownership costs becomes even clearer. In 2012, the same car would have cost an estimated R2,417.03 per month in instalments, R802.66 in insurance, and R1,856.75 in fuel. In total, excluding maintenance, the monthly cost of owning the vehicle was around R5,076.44 in 2012. Fast forward to 2025, and that same figure has climbed to R11,284.54, an increase of R6,208.10 or 122%, which far outpaces the official inflation rate of 88.7% over the same period. This trend is not isolated to one vehicle or market segment. TransUnion’s Vehicle Pricing Index confirmed that South Africans are feeling the financial squeeze across the board. According to the report, the average vehicle loan amount has risen significantly over the past four years, from R329,796 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to R401,027 by the end of 2024, an increase of R71,231. Gaoaketse emphasised that this sharp rise in vehicle-related expenses highlights the importance of making informed financial decisions. “Viewing the cost of vehicle ownership from this perspective is important and underscores the need to objectively and honestly evaluate one’s affordability level,” he said. “This needs to be considered before signing a long-term vehicle finance contract, to ensure a fulfilling vehicle ownership experience.” Basic expenses 2012 2025 Difference Monthly instalment R2,417.03 R5,554.80 +R3,137.77 Insurance R802.66 R1,827.24 +R1,024.58 Fuel R1,856.75 R3,902.50 +R2,045.75 Total R5,076.44 R11,284.54 +R6,208.10 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 43m Dark times ahead for an important South African industry Finance · 2h Tax return warning for over 500,000 taxpayers in South Africa Business · 3h R17 billion boost for South African-born billionaire since the start of 2026 Government · 5h Europe gives South Africa the green light Business · 6h Tax disaster for one of South Africa’s major employers 5 Things · 8h South Africans must still use Post Office for parcels under 1kg, and SAPS in deep trouble Industry News Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech More News Business · 9h Store cheaper than Checkers and Pick n Pay launches nationwide delivery Lifestyle · 23h South Africa’s top-performing private school with 4.3 distinctions per matriculant Government · 24h AGOA hope for South Africa Lifestyle · 1d 25-year-old foreigners are retiring in South Africa Motoring · 13 Jan 2026 Petrol price reality check for South African motorists Government · 13 Jan 2026 US sends another tariff threat to South Africa Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

It was reported that the company was approached by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) about expanding into the new vehicle space. “Around 30% of people who sell their vehicle to us go on to buy a brand new vehicle, which we do not offer them at this stage,” the group said. “If WeBuyCars also sold new vehicles, consumers could come to one place, weigh their options between new and used, and make a more informed decision.” However, chief marketing officer Rikus Blomerus told BusinessTech the group is not considering selling new vehicles at this stage, and is still focused on expanding its footprint in South Africa. “WeBuyCars has in the past been approached by OEMs to sell their models through our distribution network, however we do not have plans to include new cars in our inventory at this stage,” he said. “We are 100% focused on expanding our geographic footprint and digital capabilities in order to achieve our goal of 23,000 used cars sales per month by 2028.” Despite noting that OEMs are approaching WeBuyCars rather than the other way around, Blomerus said it comes at a time when cheaper new vehicles could impact the second-hand market. TransUnion’s latest Mobility Insights Report highlighted this trend, noting that more South African buyers opt for affordable new vehicles rather than pre-owned premium models. “South Africa’s car market is shifting from luxury brands to more affordable options, driven by rising financial pressure on households,” the report said. It added that Chinese brands are increasingly perceived as offering solid quality and good value for money. There are also concerns that spare parts and after-sales service are beginning to fade as these brands grow their dealer and service networks. This shift is reflected in the latest vehicle registration data. New passenger vehicle registrations surged by 19.1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period the previous year. By contrast, growth in used passenger vehicle registrations slowed significantly, from 4.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to just 0.9% in Q1 2025. TransUnion said this was due to easing interest rates, better availability of entry-level models, and aggressive incentives from Asian manufacturers, which pull consumers toward new rather than used vehicles. “This growing demand for affordable new models is starting to squeeze the used car market,” the report noted. WeBuyCars continues to grow Despite these pressures, WeBuyCars CEO Faan van der Walt said the impact on the used car segment has been limited for now. In comments to BusinessTech , he said the influx of low-cost Asian vehicles is more of a concern for premium new car brands than for the second-hand market. He also welcomed the broader range of affordable options entering the market, saying it benefits consumers overall. WeBuyCars continues to dominate South Africa’s used vehicle sector. It sells over 15,000 cars monthly across 17 vehicle supermarkets and 93 buying pods nationwide. This improved operational performance boosted the company’s financial results, with its revenue growing 15.2% to R13.1 billion. The company reported strong growth in its most recent financial results, with buying and selling volumes rising to 92,339 and 91,392 units, up 12.9% and 13.5% year-on-year, respectively. The company even set a new monthly record in November 2024, selling 16,294 units. Looking ahead, WeBuyCars plans to expand further by opening three new facilities by the end of the year. These facilities will be in Cape Town, Montana (Pretoria), and Vereeniging, which is expected to create 500 new jobs.

He argues this would ease traffic congestion, modernise public transport, and better use underutilised infrastructure. His plan is for a modern elevated rail system that would run from the Cape Town CBD toward the Atlantic seaboard, potentially integrating with the city’s Foreshore Freeway Bridge. According to Ramsay, this project would improve mobility in one of the city’s most congested areas and could serve as a high-capacity, future-proof alternative to current public transport solutions. The City of Cape Town, however, has stifled Ramsay’s sky train proposal. Rob Quintas, the city’s mayoral committee member for urban mobility, confirmed that the elevated railway idea is not under consideration. While the city is conducting a scoping study on the broader Foreshore Freeway Precinct to explore long-term transport and land use solutions, Quintas said that a sky train simply isn’t financially viable. “The infrastructure, rolling stock, and ongoing operations of a modern elevated railway would be prohibitively expensive when weighed against the city’s budget constraints,” he said. Additionally, Quintas pointed out that international experience shows such systems typically require continuous subsidies to remain operational. Cape Town has already committed significant resources to its MyCiti bus service, which Quintas sees as a more practical and cost-effective investment. The MyCiti network runs throughout the CBD and surrounding suburbs like Green Point and Sea Point, and the city believes that improving this service is a better use of funds than building an entirely new transport system. Ramsay, however, has challenged the city’s stance, particularly its dismissal of the sky train without what he sees as a meaningful review. He told TopAuto that the city’s statement that the train system is “not a consideration” suggests that it has not received serious scrutiny or formal evaluation. He is not opposed to the city rejecting the project if deemed unviable, but he takes issue with the apparent lack of investigation or feedback since the proposal was submitted. City of Cape Town should reconsider Ramsay acknowledged the city’s support for expanding the MyCiti network as a viable long-term solution. However, he pointed out that the physical limitations of the city’s road infrastructure, particularly in densely populated areas like Sea Point and Green Point, limit the potential capacity for the bus system. He noted that narrow roads, limited space for dedicated bus lanes, and the buses’ large turning circles all reduce their efficiency. In many parts of the city, MyCiti buses are caught in the same congestion as private vehicles, undermining their appeal as a public transport alternative. Ramsay further pointed out that future urban development, such as the mixed-use plans for the Three Anchor Bay site, will increase population density in key areas, adding even more pressure to already saturated road networks. He also highlighted the limitations of the MyCiti system during peak periods or after major events. A sky train, by contrast, could move that same number of passengers within two minutes, providing a far more efficient solution. While he acknowledged that the sky train would involve substantial upfront costs, he argued that its long-term cost-efficiency and transport benefits outweigh the initial investment. “The question is increasingly becoming less and less of whether or not we can afford it, but rather whether we can afford not to,” he said. Citing an older estimate, Ramsay noted that completing the Foreshore Freeway would cost over R2.1 billion without meaningfully improving congestion. He added that roads are vulnerable to traffic accidents that can shut down areas for hours, while a rail system avoids such delays. He also suggested that the sale of the Three Anchor Bay site, potentially worth R700 million, could help fund the initial phases of the rail project. Ramsay rejected the argument that elevated rail systems should be dismissed because of their reliance on subsidies. He said the economic and social returns, such as increased productivity, reduced commuting times, and improved commuter well-being, typically justify the public investment. “It is hypocritical to claim that extending a rail system is not viable due to subsidies, especially when the MyCiti Bus service benefits from national government subsidies,” he said. “This support is justified, given the positive impact the service has on citizens’ lives and the Cape Town economy.” He also pointed out that bus services are vulnerable to fuel price volatility, which ultimately affects commuters. Electric-powered rail systems, he argued, offer greater long-term economic and environmental stability. Ramsay believes the sky train could be a transformative transport project for Cape Town, which could alleviate traffic and improve urban development and economic growth.

Constructed in 1961, the original Kyalami Circuit was the home of the South African Grand Prix, hosting 21 F1 Grand Prix races. On top of F1, the circuit has hosted MotoGP and several other motor sport events. The last F1 Grand Prix in South Africa was hosted in 1993, just a year before South Africa transitioned to democracy. The current 4.522km layout was upgraded in 2016 and holds an FIA Grade 2 certification, with the surrounding precinct turning into a self-sustaining venue with year-round commercial activity. The circuit has now received confirmation that the Federation International de l’Automobile (FIA) has accepted proposals to upgrade the circuit to Grade 1 status. This is the highest international standard for a race track and is required to host an F1 race. “The FIA’s written acceptance of the amended design marks a significant achievement,” said the circuit. “Once the capital works are completed and a final inspection conducted, Kyalami will become Africa’s only FIA Grade 1 circuit, capable of hosting Formula 1 on the African continent.” Circuit owner Toby Venter and Clive Bowen, Founder and Director of UK-based Apex Circuit Design, said the circuit upgrade took five years of planning, which culminated in the FIA’s approval. Apex is an internationally recognised circuit design house that steered the design of the new Miami street circuit. “When we acquired Kyalami in 2014, we made a commitment to restore it not just as a world-class venue, but as a beacon for motorsport across the African continent,” said Venter. “The FIA’s acceptance of our Grade 1 design is a significant step forward in that journey.” The proposed FIA Grade 1 upgrade will require no change to the circuit’s layout, and will focus on improving run-off areas, barrier systems, debris fencing, kerbs and drainage. “This is a light-touch upgrade in engineering terms, but one that enhances the already excellent circuit standards to meet modern Grade 1 requirements,” said Bowen. The FIA plan approval gives Kyalami three years to complete the intended upgrades. Works will initially commence during periods when current business partners face no disruption to their events. Selected works will then be actioned pending the successful outcome of South Africa’s place on the F1 calendar and Kyalami being chosen as the preferred hosting venue. Competition Despite already hosting several Grand Prixes, Kyalami faces competition to be South Africa’s preferred destination for a race. The Cape Town Grand Prix SA (CTGPSA) recently announced plans to submit a bid to South Africa’s Bid Steering Committee (BSC) to return F1 to the country. Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Gayton McKenzie, has repeatedly called for the return of F1 to the country and created the BSC to oversee the bid process. CTGPSA proposed an F1 street race in the Cape Town Green Point Sport Tourism Precinct, with a 5.7km circuit around the DHL Stadium. The race could deliver a significant economic boost, with NWU economics professor Waldo Krugell noting that major events, such as F1, can lead to additional spending, accelerating economic growth. Cape Town hosted a Formula E, which exclusively features electric sports cars, in 2023, which was estimated to generate over R1 billion in economic impact, despite its relatively minor fanbase compared to F1.

The Department of Transport recently announced that the current driving licence production backlog would take four to six months to be cleared. Although the department clarified that the driving licence printer had not broken down and has been in operation since early May, it did note that the backlog sits at close to 700,000 licences. It further claimed that 269,000 cards had already been printed, but MyBroadband pointed out that this includes new card applications, with the backlog reducing by only 43,000 since 15 May. Although it usually takes about 14 days from the application date to get the card, the delay means it will probably take four to six weeks for South Africans to collect their cards. It stated that those who applied for their driver’s licence card before the current one expires can just keep the receipt with them in their car. The clarification from the department comes after reports misinterpreted Transport Minister Barbara Creecy’s response to Rise Mzansi leader Songezo Zibi over the backlog. Creecy revealed that the driving licence backlog was 733,000 as of 15 May 2025. However, MyBroadband noted that at the current printing rate of under 2,400 cards per day, it will take 13 months to clear the backlog. Calls for big changes Transport Minister Barbara Creecy With the backlog potentially stretching from four to 13 months, OUTA has asked Creecy to waive fines and temporary licences for those whose new cards are stuck in the backlog. The non-profit civil action organisation also wrote to the minister asking her to consider extending the validity of all cards to 10 years. While the card backlog exists, OUTA also called for the following: Announcing a moratorium on fines related to expired driver’s licence cards for motorists who have already applied for renewals, and that no temporary licences are required until all backlogs have been cleared. Public communication of this moratorium through all official channel,s including RTMC platforms, provincial traffic authorities and traditional and social media. Providing clarity to all enforcement officials to prevent unwarranted fines and harassment of motorists. OUTA’s Advocate Stefanie Fick said that it would be unfair to fine motorists who are still waiting for their renewed cards. The organisation has been highly involved in the licensing printing machine process, with an investigation last year uncovering significant irregularities in buying a new driving licence card machine. The tender was awarded in August, with OUTA handing over its investigation to the Minister, who in turn passed it onto the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA). In March 2025, Creecy announced that the AGSA’s investigation confirmed irregularities. The AGSA’s report found that the award of a tender worth R898 million was irregular, with the budget set for a new machine set at just over R486 million. Although Creecy said she would go to court to overturn the tender award, OUTA is still waiting for clarity on the contract process.

This is thanks to a new partnership between Durban-based importer Rospa International and global vehicle conversion specialist Autogroup International. The collaboration is set to introduce eight highly sought-after American models, which include pickup trucks, SUVs, and muscle cars, all converted to right-hand drive and fully legal for South African roads. For years, the only American car brands with a consistent presence in South Africa have been Ford and Jeep. Ford offers one of the country’s best-selling cars with its locally built Ranger bakkie, while Jeep remains a niche brand catering to off-road fans with the Wrangler SUV. However, names like GMC, Hummer, Chevrolet, and even Toyota are set to return to the local market, albeit not through official brand channels. Rospa International, well known for importing high-performance Japanese vehicles, is expanding its offering. The company was founded by Himal Chris Paul, who became fascinated with fast, exotic vehicles after a client introduced him to Japanese sports cars. Frustrated by the limited selection and poor condition of available models in South Africa, Paul eventually established a direct supply chain from Japan. This led to the formation of Rospa Imports, which quickly gained a reputation for delivering top-tier, hard-to-find performance cars. Building on that success, Rospa has signed a formal agreement with Autogroup International, a specialist firm that converts American vehicles from left-hand to right-hand drive for export markets. With this partnership, Rospa becomes the official distributor and service partner for Autogroup in South Africa. The companies said the move will provide local buyers access to American vehicles that were previously off-limits. This will include full compliance with South African National Standards (SANS), after-sales support, and a 3-year/100,000km warranty. According to the announcement, at least eight distinct models will initially be available. These include: Ford F-250 Super Duty pickup truck Ford F-350 Super Duty pickup truck Ford F-450 Super Duty pickup truck GMC Sierra 2500 pickup truck GMC Sierra 3500 pickup truck GMC Yukon Denali Ultimate XL SUV Hummer EV Toyota Tundra pickup truck Most of these vehicles will be offered in multiple trims, such as the TRD Pro and Capstone Edition for the Toyota Tundra, and the AT4X AEV and Denali Ultimate trims for the GMC Sierra, giving buyers a wider range of options to suit their preferences. Potential for more to come In addition to these pickups and SUVs, the partnership promises to bring a selection of iconic American muscle cars to local shores. However, in a previous statement, the company mentioned that the Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger, and Chevrolet Camaro were on the cards. This would bring the total number of models available to 11, not counting variant trims. One of the most appealing aspects of the deal is the assurance that these vehicles will be road-legal in South Africa. All models undergo a complete homologation process, ensuring they meet local regulatory standards. That means buyers can enjoy peace of mind knowing their imported American muscle car or pickup truck is fully certified and supported locally. After-sales service will be handled by Rospa International, which has trained technicians stationed in South Africa’s major cities and access to a dedicated spare parts network. “This is a major milestone, not just for us, but for South African automotive enthusiasts who have long dreamed of owning a right-hand drive American pickup truck or SUV that meets local standards,” said Rob Hill, CEO of Autogroup International. Himal Chris Paul echoed the sentiment, adding that the partnership represents a new chapter for Rospa, opening the door to a new group of clients waiting to access vehicles of this calibre.

Ferreira said Intercape now faces consistent terrorist attacks, and the South African Police Service (SAPS) refuses to take action. He alleged that the South African taxi industry has close ties with influential politicians, who protect the people behind the attacks on his company. Intercape is Southern Africa’s largest bus operator and a vital transport service provider used by millions of South Africans. The company was founded by Johan Ferreira in 1971 with a single bus. It grew rapidly, and by 1976, it had expanded to five buses. In 1979, Ferreira started a second passenger bus company in Cape Town and called it Intercape, operating a shuttle service between the Cape Town airport and the City Centre. In 1986, Intercape applied for and obtained intercity permits for transporting passengers between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. In 2008, Johann Ferreira Junior, who had joined the company in 1986, acquired 100% of Intercape’s shares from the Ferreira family trust and took over its management. Ferreira was highly experienced and had all the necessary skills to run the transportation company, which had been in his family for decades. However, he was not prepared for what followed. In 2016, taxi operators began to question the validity of Intercape’s bus permits on specific routes. They held meetings with local authorities and the provincial regulatory entities responsible for issuing permits. Everything was in order, and Intercape continued with its services. What followed was a low-level war, which escalated and ended with what Ferreira described as terrorist attacks. “When the taxi bosses saw they could not legally stop Intercape, they went underground and started attacking the buses,” he said. He told Kyknet’s Lourensa Eckard that it started with victimising the drivers and the passengers and throwing stones at buses. When this did not work, they escalated their actions, which included shooting at the Intercape buses on specific routes. “They assaulted the drivers and passengers, stopping buses at the bus stations in the Eastern Cape and pulling passengers from the buses, armed with guns,” he said. Ferreira said it ended with full-scale terrorism. “It escalated to a point where a driver was murdered and many passengers were injured,” he explained. The police did not take decisive action What is particularly concerning is that the South African Police Service (SAPS) made no effort to arrest anyone despite 200 pending cases. Ferreira explained that they could not take legal action against the taxi industry, as it is impossible to find the bosses behind the scenes. “You don’t get a real address. You don’t get a real name. Nothing is real. Everything is underground and undercover,” he said. Instead, the company requested that the police address these issues. However, they found that the police were unwilling to act against the perpetrators. “We opened cases and got a case number. However, after that, there was no action from the police,” he said. They have also called out the police when their buses were attacked. They would either not come out, or when they did, they were unwilling to intervene. “They refuse to arrest anyone who attacked an Intercape bus. There has not been a single arrest in all our cases,” he said. This is despite passengers being forced to exit the buses by criminals using automatic rifles and employees being driven out of their offices through violent means. In one case, the criminals held a Cape Town station hostage for 4 hours. However, the police only acted as observers. “They held me hostage and threatened me for 8 hours in East London using AK-47 assault rifles. They wanted to eliminate Intercape,” he said. To try to address the police’s inaction, Intercape approached the courts to force the law enforcement agencies to act. On 10 July 2024, Intercape announced that it had won its fifth court battle over this matter, including cases against the Police and Transport Minister. However, this also came to nothing. They continued to launch successful legal action and have contested nine court cases. “We won all the cases with costs,” Ferreirsa said. Despite numerous court orders, the problems persist. “At this stage, the state is in contempt of court,” the Intercape CEO said. The court ordered the police and the Department of Transport to develop a plan to protect Intercape and report back to the court and the company. This did not happen. The court also ordered the police to investigate cases and arrest perpetrators. They also did not do that. “That means the police are in contempt of court on two counts, and the Department of Transport is in contempt of court on one count,” he said. Ferreira blamed President Cyril Ramaphosa for the lack of action. He alleged that Ramaphosa supports the taxi industry, which stops organs of state from doing their work. “It is unthinkable that the government would expose their citizens to terrorism and do nothing about it. This is what the court said,” Ferreira said. He equated it to human rights abuses and said he is not going to drop this issue. “The government should protect its citizens,” he said. Intercape goes to parliament On Wednesday, 14 May 2025, Intercape appeared before the Portfolio Committee on Police to urge the police to take action to halt the ongoing acts of violence and intimidation. The Portfolio Committee, chaired by Ian Cameron of the DA, heard evidence of “attacks on long-haul bus operations” and the police’s lack of response to the crisis. Advocate Kate Hofmeyr told the committee that the attacks against Intercape were severe and that the SAPS’ response was inadequate. The financial toll on Intercape has been significant, causing millions in damages. It has covered medical bills for injured passengers amounting to over R420,000. It was forced to suspend services in certain towns in the Eastern Cape, resulting in lost revenue of over R30 million. It incurred over R3 million in additional expenditure for private security escorts. It spent nearly R5.5 million on repair costs for damaged coaches. Intercape said the rot runs much deeper than just the police’s inability to get a handle on the violence and intimidation directed against its operations. The company says the government does not respect the rule of law and is in breach of its Constitutional obligations.

The problem relates to the South African Civil Aviation Authority’s (SACAA) decision to enforce a rigid 12-year engine overhaul rule. The issue made headlines two years ago when the CAA wanted to force any aircraft with an engine older than 12 years to be overhauled before it could be placed back in service. The Aeronautical Information Circular (AIC) 18.19 provided an exemption and an alternate method of compliance through an inspection to ensure safe, continued airworthiness. In 2023, the CAA withdrew AIC 18.19 without consultation, causing havoc among flight schools, aircraft owners, students, and commercial operators. The Democratic Alliance (DA) said the CAA’s mishandling of the situation caused significant losses, and businesses faced circumstances that could lead to their liquidation. The issue has since died down. However, a new development meant that a large group of fixed-wing aeroplanes and helicopters in South Africa had been grounded overnight. It includes aeroplanes and helicopters with Textron-Lycoming and Teledyne Continental engines, and possibly Pratt & Whitney and Rotax engines, that have not been overhauled in the past 12 years. The group sounding the alarm includes the Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa (CAASA), the Aeroclub of South Africa, and the Aviation Watch Action Committee. It also includes the Aviation Action Group and concerned aircraft owners, pilots, engineers and operators. The group said an insurance underwriter estimates up to 70% of the ageing fleet of fixed-wing aeroplanes and helicopters in South Africa could be affected. They added that the South African Civil Aviation Authority’s latest move to rescind an Air Information Circular created chaos in the aviation industry. It follows successive general exemptions and unsuccessful deliberations over the past two years to oppose the new regulation. They said the sudden intervention means that an entire sector of the aviation industry could subsequently grind to a halt. The knock-on effects in the value chain could harm food security, conservation, safety, and tourism, as well as private business enterprises, amounting to billions of rand. Severe impact on South Africa’s aviation industry The group said scores of owners and operators may not yet be aware that they might be flying with effectively ‘un-airworthy’ aircraft, illegally, and without any insurance cover. Few aircraft owners, especially those operating under Part 91 operations, can afford to overhaul their aircraft engines prematurely and are highly likely to stop flying altogether. Many operators may subsequently have to dismiss staff and close their doors, as the costs of a premature major overhaul could vary between R1 million and R2.5 million. Owners and pilots operating under Part 92 operations for leisurely activities, including ultra- and microlight aircraft or gyroplanes, are currently not affected. Most private owners and pilots operating in the Part 91 category of operations use their aircraft for private business and to gain access to clients across the SADC region. It said no empirical evidence exists to indicate that safety is being compromised, which would compel owners to carry out overhauls based on years instead of the number of hours flown. The original rationale for factories to recommend overhauling engines every 12-years was based on passive storage and inactive engines. The rescinded AIC was aimed at mitigating any potential harmful effects. No empirical evidence was ever presented to warrant the rescinding. Kevin Storie, CEO of the Commercial Aviation Association of South Africa, told Biznews that well above 1,400 aircraft are affected. He explained that the CAA decided not to issue a certificate of airworthiness to these aircraft, forcing owners to self-ground them. He said engine overhauls can cost well above R2 million and that spare parts are scarce and subject to prohibitive US tariffs, making compliance practically impossible. The impact is devastating to training schools, which rely on twin-engine planes, while tourism, which uses small aircraft to move high-end clients across the region, faces severe disruption. He said the new directive decimates a decades-old ecosystem of aviation expertise and economic activity. Storie warned that the entire value chain is at risk, including the aviation maintenance organisations (AMOs), spare parts suppliers, and training academies. The South African Civil Aviation Authority insists that its implementation of the rule ensures that flying is safer. However, Storie disagrees. “This isn’t about safety. It’s about control and a failure to understand the consequences of that control,” he said.

South Africans who sell their vehicles privately are often protected by the so-called “voetstoots” clause in the sales agreement. But legal experts have warned that it won’t cover them from intentional misrepresentation. The voetstoots clause is a common feature of most sale agreements when dealing with vehicles or even immovable property. The provision is that the purchaser agrees to buy the car or property as it stands, indemnifying the seller against claims of damages and defects, whether visible or latent. Latent defects are ‘hidden flaws’ that are not easily seen or observed during inspections which may impair the utility of the vehicle or property for its intended purpose. While the voetstoots clause is included to protect sellers from claims down the line, South Africa’s courts have made it clear that it is not a blanket protection. According to legal experts, in cases where sellers have knowingly hidden defects or misrepresented the state of the vehicle or property, the voetstoots clause could fall away. A seller is typically shielded from liability under a ‘voetstoots’ clause unless they knew of the defect and deliberately withheld the information or acted fraudulently. A misrepresentation, on the other hand, is when a seller falsely represents that goods are free of defects or intentionally conceals critical flaws to get the buyer to make the purchase. In such an event, the buyer may be able to rely on this misrepresentation to cancel the sale. A new case shows that voetstoots can also fall away when there is an oral contract of sale in place. Law firm Wright Rose-Innes flagged a case in 2025 where the court found in favour of a purchaser, when it was proven that the seller had materially mispresented the condition of a second-hand vehicle. The vehicle was sold to the applicant, falsely described as “accident-free” with a “full-service record.” Upon discovering that the vehicle had extensive latent defects and had been involved in a prior collision, the purchaser sought to cancel the sale and reclaim his payment on the grounds of misrepresentation. “The court ordered that the purchaser was entitled to cancel the oral contract of sale and claim restitution based upon the misrepresentation,” it said. “The takeaway is that a ‘voetstoots’ clause cannot be used as a shield for fraudulent behaviour and that honesty is critical when selling goods.” Unfortunately for buyers in South Africa, honesty is not always part of the deal, and there are limited options for making sure you’re not buying a dud. Beware when buying a second-hand car Sambra head, Juan Hanekom There have been several court cases over the past few years raising red flags about dodgy second-hand purchases in South Africa, where bargain hunters have been left with a wreck. Industry bodies such as the South African Motor Body Repairer’s Association (Sambra) have reported growing instances of unsuspecting buyers ending up with vehicles that have been written off in accidents and salvaged. “Many cars classified as Code 2 (Used) in eNaTIS records may have been involved in severe accidents or declared uneconomical to repair by the relevant insurer, and are still being marketed through online platforms, deceiving consumers and creating safety risks,” the group warned. Juan Hanekom, national director of Sambra, said that the current testing regime to root these vehicles out is not comprehensive enough, and that even a roadworthy check is not a safeguard. “We only check for visible signs of damage, but if sub-standard repairs to a car is well concealed, it is difficult to detect accident damage within the scope and equipment constraints of a roadworthy inspection.” While there are pathways for buyers to take action and get their money back — like the Motor Industry Ombudsman — Sambra has called for a more dedicated legislative approach. The industry body has been pushing for South Africa to develop a full vehicle salvage database, which would provide comprehensive information about vehicles to consumers, dealers, banks, and repairers. In 2023, the South African Insurance Association (SAIA) launched a web-based tool for consumers to check on the status of a vehicle using its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The VIN provides information about the vehicle’s manufacturer, model, year, and other details, such as whether it was involved in a wreck or has other issues. However, Sambra said that, while this is good progress, more needs to be done. “It only scratches the surface and unfortunately does not address the full magnitude of the problem,” it said. The group said the government needs to draft new legislation that defines vehicle code statuses and integrates them into the existing eNaTIS system. “This is the key to unlocking a transparent vehicle history database accessible to all stakeholders,” it said. Sambra said the government also needs to rethink vehicles codes, proposing new labels based on the extent of the damage. For instance, Code A: Irreparable; must be crushed; Code B: Non-repairable body but with salvageable parts and Code N: Non-structural damage; can be repaired to a roadworthy condition, etcetera. “The infrastructure for such a system already exists in South Africa. We simply need to legislate the codes,” it said.

This is good news for one of South Africa’s most important employers, which experienced a notable slowdown in 2024. The Automotive Business Council, Naamsa, highlighted at the end of last year that total aggregate vehicle sales for the year declined by 3%, marking the lowest point since the Covid-19 pandemic. The council pointed to poor economic growth, falling consumer confidence, and purchasing power as the main culprits. However, there are signs that the tide is turning for the industry, with double-digit growth recorded for May 2025 driven by domestic policy shifts and steady sales momentum. Domestic new vehicle sales surged in May, with 45,308 units sold, a 22% increase from the 37,139 vehicles sold in May 2024. Passenger car sales, in particular, jumped 30% year-on-year to 31,741 units. Light commercial vehicles, including bakkies and mini-buses, also grew by nearly 6% to 10,938 units. “After eight consecutive months of growth, May’s sales data puts to rest any lingering doubts about the industry’s resilience,” said the council. Dealer sales accounted for 88.4% of the total, with the rest spread across rental, corporate, and government purchases. Naamsa added that the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB) decision to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points in May was widely welcomed across the industry. It ended a prolonged cycle of monetary tightening and sent a strong signal of support for growth, affordability, and macroeconomic stability. “The SARB’s latest decision to lower interest rates is timely and commendable. It directly supports consumer affordability and boosts production competitiveness when global uncertainty weighs heavily on our export markets,” said Naamsa CEO Mikel Mabasa. The move is expected to stimulate consumer demand through more affordable credit and reduced borrowing costs, while also giving much-needed breathing room to manufacturers facing rising input costs and global competition. Good news for hundreds of thousands of jobs The momentum extended to medium and heavy truck segments, with medium commercial vehicle sales increasing by 22.7% and heavy trucks and buses up by 6.7%. These figures suggest renewed activity in logistics, construction, and industrial sectors, which rely heavily on commercial transport. This is good news for an industry widely considered one of South Africa’s largest and most important employers. According to the National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) , the automotive value chain stretches far beyond original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). It noted last year that South Africa’s 1,600+ dealerships and their associated ecosystems form the backbone of automotive retail and support an estimated 500,000 to 1 million people. These jobs span the associated ecosystems, including finance, logistics, fuel, repairs, and service centres. Additionally, these businesses contribute billions to GDP annually and are critical to sustaining the sector’s overall health. From a manufacturing standpoint, lower interest rates are expected to reduce capital costs, allowing OEMs to invest in tooling, retooling, and model upgrades. This investment is vital for future-proofing the industry and positioning South Africa as a globally competitive production hub. With inflation expectations now anchored lower, Naamsa sees this as an opportunity to spur new capital expenditure. Adding further potential tailwinds, Naamsa has expressed optimism about the ongoing discussions between National Treasury and the SARB on lowering the country’s official inflation target to 3.0% from its current 4.5% midpoint. “A structural decline in inflation expectations could support permanently lower interest rates,” Naamsa said. “This would be transformative for automotive consumers and would improve manufacturers’ cost competitiveness.” However, not all developments have been positive. While domestic sales are booming, concerns are mounting over export performance. May 2025 saw vehicle export sales decline by 14.6% to 30,112 units, down from 35,277 units a year earlier. Though year-to-date exports are still slightly ahead, up 1.4%, the monthly dip is a red flag. The drop was largely due to a temporary production halt by a major exporting OEM that paused operations for facility upgrades ahead of a new model rollout. Still, the decline underscores a deeper vulnerability. “The fragility of global demand in the face of rising protectionism is increasing,” Naamsa warned. “Maintaining export competitiveness will require policy alignment, market diversification, and value-chain resilience.” Geopolitical tensions, global trade fragmentation, and tariff risks make exports more unpredictable. In this context, the SARB’s interest rate cut serves as an economic stimulus and strategic support for an industry navigating uncertain terrain.

However, prospective buyers are warned that some might not survive. This is due to the intense competition in the affordable market, and those who buy brands that don’t meet the cut will face poor resale values and concerns over parts. This is the warning from WeBuyCars CEO Faan van der Walt, who cautioned South Africans to think twice before making the final decision. Chinese car brands have rapidly gained traction in South Africa, offering an appealing mix of affordability and high-tech features. As of May 2025, there are 41 new passenger Chinese cars to choose from, with prices ranging from as low as R269,900 to as much as R1.4 million. However, speaking to CapeTalk, Van der Walt warned prospective buyers that a new and highly competitive environment has disadvantages. While many Chinese vehicles are doing well, not all are likely to survive in the South African market, which could have costly consequences for consumers. This warning comes as competition in the affordable vehicle segment intensifies, with global economic pressures making price the top priority for many South African buyers. As Van der Walt points out, affordability now drives purchasing decisions, and that’s precisely where Chinese automakers excel. “They offer good specs, modern technology, and competitive pricing, which makes them attractive alternatives to traditional brands,” he said. An analysis by BusinessTech revealed that vehicles from Asia, including those from Chery and Suzuki, have experienced significant growth over the past decade. In 2014, these two car brands collectively sold 7,699 units. This has increased by a whopping 887% to 76,020 in 2024. This is primarily thanks to Suzuki’s impressive growth, which increased sales from 6,402 in 2014 to 56,109 (776%) in 2024. While Suzuki almost hit 60,000 sales last year, Chery grew 1,435% from 1,297 to 19,911 in 2024. A word of caution Brothers Dirk and Faan van der Walt, the founders of WeBuyCars. In early 2025, Suzuki overtook the Volkswagen Group to become South Africa’s second-biggest car brand after Toyota, according to Naamsa. This boom has also extended to the used car market. Van der Walt confirmed that second-hand Chinese vehicles are selling quickly. “Our Chinese brands that we sell as used vehicles do really well. They don’t stick around for long,” he said. “They sell quickly because, just as there’s demand for them as new vehicles, there’s also a demand for them as used vehicles.” He explained that Chinese vehicles are hitting the sweet spot for buyers looking for value. “From a second-hand value perspective, I would say most of these vehicles are already in a price bracket where there are plenty of buyers around,” he added. “They don’t have steep depreciation curves. You could typically buy a high-end Chinese vehicle for around R450,000 to R500,000.” Van der Walt noted that the price puts them in direct competition with popular models like the Toyota Corolla or VW Polo, making them very appealing to value-conscious consumers. “It’s very competitive if you consider that’s the price you pay for a high-end Corolla or Polo,” he said. However, Van der Walt highlighted the risk of such a rapidly expanding market. With many Chinese carmakers only recently entering the South African market, long-term support, parts availability, and resale values for some brands remain uncertain. “You might end up purchasing a vehicle with a very poor resale value because they’re no longer represented in South Africa,” he warned. “It’s fantastic to have a variety of brands available, and we’re getting good value for our money,” Van der Walt added. “However, just as we’ve seen certain European car manufacturers try to establish themselves here and ultimately fail, I’m certain that some Chinese manufacturers will also give up at some point.” “So, stick with the known Chinese brands for now until these other brands build a reputation as being reliable and around for the long run.” He also noted that South Africans have historically associated these brands with poor quality, poor resale value, and generally inferior quality, but that’s no longer the case. Still, he urged South Africans to be cautious. With so many Chinese manufacturers trying to gain a foothold in international markets, not all will survive. Van der Walt says the key is not to be swayed purely by price. “Think twice before making that final decision.” “If a brand fails to take off or exits the country, owners could be left with a car that’s hard to maintain, and even harder to sell.” Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 18m Ramaphosa sends a warning to the ANC Government · 37m New state of disaster on the cards for South Africa Business Opinion · 2h In contemplation of Sapiens – the species and the book 5 Things · 2h Prime interest rate ‘cartel’ investigation in South Africa, and South African retail giant in hot water Business · 3h Jobs in South Africa that don’t need experience or qualifications Lifestyle · 17h Unique South African school achieves 100% university exemption and 4.4 distinctions per student Industry News Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines More News Energy · 18h South Africans to pay for R76 billion mistake Government · 19h Dark times ahead for an important South African industry Finance · 20h Tax return warning for over 500,000 taxpayers in South Africa Business · 21h R17 billion boost for South African-born billionaire since the start of 2026 Government · 23h Europe gives South Africa the green light Business · 1d Tax disaster for one of South Africa’s major employers Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

This is according to the South African Police Service’s (SAPS) latest quarterly crime statistics for the fourth quarter of 2024/25—January to March 2025. Despite South Africa having seen a decrease in hijackings year-on-year, the number of hijackings remains high. Presenting the latest quarterly crime statistics, the SAPS noted that 4,533 cars were hijacked over the three months. This is a significant 15.1% decrease compared to the first three months of 2024. However, this equates to approximately 50 cars being stolen daily, which is still a notable concern. This number worsens when you include the unreported incidents in the latest Victims of Crime (VoC) survey. The VoC survey looks at crimes through the victim’s experience, including a significant number of crimes that go unreported in South Africa. According to the report, the number of hijackings has declined by double digits, much like the SAPS data, decreasing by 28.9%. However, this decline is from 114,000 incidents to 81,000, meaning the number of hijackings per day decreased from 312 to 222, which is still alarmingly high. According to the SAPS, only one province experienced a year-on-year increase in hijackings for the most recent quarter: the North West. Interestingly, five provinces saw a significant decrease (>20%) in hijackings. These where Mpumalanga (-35.4%), the Eastern Cape (-32.4%), Limpopo (-31.8%), Kwa-Zulu Natal (-25.7%), and the Western Cape (23.5%). Carjackings are prevalent in South Africa’s most populous regions, such as Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape. Over the first three months in 2025, Gauteng saw 2,488 hijackings, representing 55% of all carjackings. Kwa-Zulu Natal saw 583 carjackings, and the Western Cape experienced 536 carjackings. The suburb with the most hijackings The Kopanong Sports Complex in Ivory Park Looking at more granular station data for Q4 2024, Gauteng has the most hijackings per region, with Ivory Park in Midrand having the most cases. Ivory Park is occupied by more than 182,000 people and is located in Midrand, in the Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. It is situated adjacent to the township of Tembisa in the neighbouring City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. Ivory Park recorded 67 incidents in the first three months, which is just under one hijacking every day. Mamelodi East followed this with 65 hijackings over the period, and Umlazi in KZN with 64. Jabulani in Johannesburg, Gauteng, had the highest increase in reported cases, rising by 119% from 26 to 57 compared to last year. Below are the top hijacking hotspots across the most populated provinces for the most recent quarter (January to March 2025). Gauteng: Ivory Park Mamelodi East Akasia Jabulani Moroka Kwa-Zulu Natal: Umlazi Bhekithemba Western Cape: Delft Lingelethu-West Nyanga Mfuleni Harare Targeted vehicles Wahl Bartmann, CEO of Fidelity Group, told BusinessTech that vehicle hijackings are largely a business driven by demand and supply in South Africa. Popular models are targeted due to the high demand for their parts or resale value, often through illicit markets. For years, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford cars have been the most targeted vehicles, and this still holds true. However, the rise of Chinese automakers in the South African market has introduced new targets. Fidelity ADT first flagged this in the middle of last year. While Fidelity did not specify particular models, industry trends and sales data from Naamsa provide some insights. The Haval Jolion and Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, which ranked among the top-selling cars at the end of 2024, are likely targets. Larger SUVs like the Haval H6 and Chery Tiggo 7 Pro also remain popular among the brands and are thus at risk. These vehicles join perennial favourites on hijackers’ lists, which are: VW Polo Toyota Hilux Ford Ranger Toyota Corolla Cross Toyota Fortuner Haval Jolion Chery Tiggo 4 Pro Haval H6 Chery Tiggo 7 Pro The SAPS’ latest data showed that 2,016 of the vehicles hijacked were sedans, hatchbacks, and coupes, followed by bakkies and panel vans, with 1,503 hijackings. These vehicle segments represented 44% and 33% of all the hijacked cars over the most recent quarter.

BAIC, short for Beijing Automotive Industry Corp., is a Chinese state-owned automobile manufacturer. It formed a partnership with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) to establish BAIC South Africa in 2016. According to the agreement, BAIC holds a 65% stake in the local division, while IDC owns the remaining 35%. A factory was then opened in 2018, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were in attendance. Located at the Coega Special Economic Zone in Gqeberha, the project was China’s largest investment outside Europe. The R11 billion plant had a vehicle assembly line, press shop, paint shop, body shop, administrative offices, and a neighbouring supplier park for component manufacturers to support production. Despite the growing popularity of Chinese automakers in South Africa, specifically GWM and Chery, the BAIC factory has struggled with production since its launch. In 2024, City Press reported that the plant had assembled only 300 units in six years. It missed all its targets. For context, the Ford Silverton plant in Pretoria produces over 700 bakkies daily. BAIC aimed to produce between 40,000 and 50,000 vehicles annually for both local and export markets, which would have created approximately 3,000 jobs by the end of 2022. The company attributed the poor performance to labour disputes, the Covid-19 pandemic, and supplier troubles. The company also noted that the South African market is too small to support the whole operation of the plant, with the company needing to grow its brand and market share. BAIC South Africa also did not benefit from the government’s incentives of the Automotive Production and Development Programme (APDP), which allows rebates and subsidies. Production at the factory started with the D20 and then the X25, but both models were discontinued. The X55 was then introduced and proved popular with the local market, scooping car of the year awards. Positive signs Recent government meetings have indicated an increase in investment from BAIC to expand the plant’s services. Chinese ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng visited BAIC’s headquarters in Beijing in April, where its chairman told him that BAIC plans to expand its plant in South Africa. Peng said that the expansion would come despite the impact of unreasonable US tariffs. These comments came amidst heightened tensions over the country’s extremely high tariffs. However, tariffs have since been lowered following negotiations between the countries. South African Minister in the Presidency Responsible for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, Maropene Ramokgopa, visited the BAIC factory last week. As the District Development Model Champion in Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan, Ramokopga led a delegation to meet with BAIC’s leadership, The meeting focused on deepening collaboration in implementing reforms to accelerate development. The increased production could further cement BAIC and the presence of Chinese manufacturers in South Africa. Several brands have seen a sharp drop in sales over the last decade, with many consumers facing increased cost pressures amidst heightened interest rates and slow real wage growth. Chinese brands are excelling in this department by providing high-quality specifications, advanced technology and competitive pricing, which makes them an attractive alternative to normal luxury brands. Another indicator of the Chinese car brand’s success in South Africa is its growing presence in vehicle financing deals. Standard Bank’s vehicle finance division revealed that its share of Chinese brands in new financing deals increased from 6% in 2022 to 7.4%. BAIC is still behind GWM, Haval, and Chery in terms of the most populated brands financed by Standard Bank.

According to the latest TransUnion Vehicle Price Index for Q4 2024, the South African automotive sector experienced a cautious recovery, influenced by improved macroeconomic factors. The report highlighted that interest rate cuts, lower inflation, and a stronger rand contributed to increased consumer confidence and enhanced vehicle affordability. However, despite these positive developments, rising costs, evolving brand preferences, and shifting financing trends continued to shape the market as affordability became the primary concern. This is where Chinese brands excel. Their vehicles provide high-quality specifications, advanced technology, and competitive pricing, making them an attractive alternative to traditional luxury brands. An analysis by BusinessTech showed that vehicles from Asia, such as Chery and Suzuki, have seen massive growth over the past decade. In 2014, these two car brands collectively sold 7,699 units. This has increased by a whopping 887% to 76,020 in 2024. This is primarily thanks to Sukuzi’s impressive growth, which increased sales from 6,402 in 2014 to 56,109 (776%) in 2024. While Suzuki almost hit 60,000 sales last year, Chery grew 1,435% from 1,297 to 19,911 in 2024. This growth resulted in a notable milestone at the start of 2025. According to Naamsa, Suzuki officially surpassed the Volkswagen Group to become South Africa’s second-best-selling car brand, trailing only Toyota. Another clear indicator of Chinese car brands’ success in South Africa is their growing presence in vehicle financing deals. Data from Standard Bank’s vehicle finance division revealed that the share of Chinese brands in the bank’s new car financing deals increased from just over 6% in 2022 to 7.4%. This growth is impressive given the broader decline in new car sales nationwide, highlighting the increasing preference for Chinese models. Among the Chinese brands, GWM Haval continues to lead the pack as the most popular brand financed by Standard Bank, followed closely by Chery and BAIC. These brands have gained the most traction in Gauteng, accounting for 54% of all Chinese car financing deals, while KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape also contribute to their growing popularity. In addition to new car sales, the used car market for Chinese brands is also expanding rapidly. Standard Bank reports that the proportion of used Chinese cars financed by the bank rose from 20% in 2022 to 36% by 2024. All the Chinese cars you can buy BYD Sealion 7 As of May, 41 Chinese passenger cars are available in South Africa. Almost all of them are SUVs, apart from several bakkies. This is likely due to the surge in SUV popularity in South Africa, as SUVS offer more space and better clearance on the country’s tough roads. The cheapest model is the Chery Tiggo 4 Pro SUV, which starts at R279,900. It uses a 1.5-litre, naturally aspirated petrol engine with 83kW and 138Nm. Regarding fuel consumption, the manual uses an average of 7.0L/100km, while the CVT consumes a slightly more economical 6.8L/100km. On this list, almost half (20) are priced under R500,000, and 12 are under R400,000. However, not all Chinese cars are cheap. The most expensive car on this list is the MG Cyberster, an all-electric two-door convertible sports car with a starting price of R1,399,990. It is available in a single specification with all-wheel drive and a 77 kWh battery, which affords a driving range of 443km. Power is sourced from two motors mounted over each axle, with the front unit generating 375kW while the back adds another 250kW. This allows the MG to sprint to 100km/h in just 3.2 seconds before reaching a maximum speed of 208km/h.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/824795/big-changes-for-taxis-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:16:40+00:00,,Big changes for taxis in South Africa,,"Motoring Staff Writer 20 May 2025 Motoring Big changes for taxis in South Africa Staff Writer · 20 May 2025 The Department of Transport is forging ahead with its overhaul of South Africa’s minibus taxi operations, including the scrapping of over 1,900 vehicles and converting 400 to use alternative fuel. The department presented its progress on the Taxi Recapitalisation plan to the Portfolio Committee on Transport on Tuesday (20 May). A key aspect of the plan is fulfilling the mandate of getting illegally converted panel vans (minibus taxis) off South Africa’s roads, as well as modernising the industry through various projects. These include new measures to open retail markets (for spare parts, service etc) for the taxi industry to participate in, building automated fare collection into the systems, and creating an app-based environment for owners and entrepreneurs in the sector. Another key development for taxis is Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) conversions for fuel, which the department said should lower the cost of fuel for taxis by 35%. The department’s Taxi Recapitalisation Projects (TRP) aims to get unsafe and unroadworthy taxis off South Africa’s road. By voluntarily surrendering these taxis to authorities for scrapping, businesses and owners could gain access to an allowance as a deposit to recapitalise a new, compliant taxi vehicle. However, the voluntary surrender of these taxis lapsed in January 2023, and the department is now impounding any illegally converted Toyota Panel Vans used to transport passengers for reward. As of May 2025, the department said it had over 2,350 such illegal vans on its records, of which 436 were able to be retrofitted for proper use. This left 1,916 vans to be considered for scrapping. Through the TRP, approximately 1,243 were linked to operating licences and qualified for recapitalisation, of which 650 vehicles have been scrapped and owners paid. 593 are in the pipeline. Approximately 670 vehicles do not qualify for recapitalisation, it said, with a total of 1,260 illegal taxis still to be scrapped overall. The department stressed that any vehicles that have not been submitted for scrapped can no longer be licenced and are operating illegally on South African roads. These vehicles will be impounded by law enforcement, it said. Converting taxis to use alternative fuel The department said the next phase of the TRP is currently underway with a host of pilot projects that started in the 2024/25 financial year and will continue until 2026/27. These include: Container retail solutions Automated fare collection Virtual association app Alternative fuel through LPG and 24 hour service centres The container retail units have been trialled since 2023, with the latest launching in March 2025. These retail units allow the taxi industry to use fully-equipped 12m shipping containers to conduct services and retail businesses for the sector. They’re self-contained retail solutions managed by the taxi associations themselves. The automated fare collection and virtual association app projects are further measures to help formalise the taxi industry. This should better integrate them into city networks, while improving driver competency and passenger safety. One of the key projects, which has also been floated for wider use in South Africa, is a conversion project to allow taxis to use LPG as fuel. The department said that LPG is the most viable alternative fuel as it is more accessible and effective than compressed natural gas (CNG). It is also easier for taxis to use because of the ease of conversion for a minibus taxi with a conversion kit. This would give taxis a stable and existing fuel source, with savings to operators of between 30% and 35%, it said, while also benefiting the environment. Operators would run cleaner engines with longer lifespans and maintenance, with dual systems suggested for longer range. An added benefit is that formal pumps for LPG already exist at specific forecourts, while other measures, such as mounted portable units, could be used in more remote areas. Currently, only seven taxis have been coverted as part of a pilot project for LPG use, but the department said it is developing a national rollout model with the plan to install 400 conversion kits.

Car rental companies such as Avis offer professional chauffeur packages for matrics, with costs from R13,730 for the service. However, this fee can double depending on your preferences. For many Grade 12 pupils, the matric dance is more than just a school-leaving event; it’s an opportunity to step into the spotlight and bid a stylish farewell to high school. The matric dance is a formal event influenced by Western-style proms. What was once a simple evening of formal wear and dancing has now evolved into a full-scale production. They often entail extravagant dresses, custom suits, designer shoes, expert make-up artists and photographers, and luxury car arrivals. However, these demands are accompanied by escalating prices that parents must pay for their children to participate. A poll conducted by News24 at the end of 2024 revealed that the average parent spent over R10,000 on their children’s matric dance requirements. Some parents spent over R45,000, while one parent withdrew the maximum R30,000 from her two-pot retirement fund to pay for her daughter’s matric dance. Despite the financial pain for some parents, this type of spending has become a notable opportunity for certain businesses in South Africa. These dances generate so much potential for revenue that a Matric Expo was held at Menlyn Park Shopping Centre from 28 February to 2 March 2025. The expo featured over 60 exhibitors, ranging from photographers and tailors to event planners, makeup and hairstylists. Arrivals are a significant part of any matric dance, and hiring luxury cars such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Range Rover, and even Ferrari, Porsche, and Lamborghini has become a trend. Parents can spend thousands on renting these vehicles if they don’t already own one, and some rental companies are capitalising on this trend, including Avis. Professional chauffeur packages for matric dances Avis Rent a Car South Africa, better known as Avis, is a South African car rental company headquartered in Kempton Park, Gauteng. Avis announced last year that it would offer its Luxury Car and Chauffeur Drive for matric dances. The rental company offers this service nationwide, with main branches in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, and Bloemfontein. “Imagine being the proud parents dropping off their matriculant and date at the dance entrance in a Mercedes-Benz AMG G-Class,” said Avis. “And if you want them to feel like a celebrity for the night, consider booking with Avis Chauffeur Drive.” The rental company added that its professional chauffeurs provide the red-carpet treatment. They have also received basic first aid, basic firefighting, and advanced driver training. According to Avis, the cost of hiring a chauffeur for a matric dance varies widely based on the type of car and the duration of service. Prices range from R800 per hour to R31,510 for a whole 24 hours, depending on the car you choose to rent. Considering this, BusinessTech looked at what was on offer for a maximum of nine hours, which should give you enough time from 16h00 pre-drinks to the end of the after-party at midnight, 24h00. With this parameter, the costs can range from R4,065 for a Toyota Corolla Quest, to R13,730 for an Audi RSQ8 Quattro, BMW M3 Competition, BMW X7, or a Range Rover Sport D350. If these cars aren’t your style, the Avis Chauffeur Drive service for matric dances offers 26 other cars from seven luxury brands. For worried parents, Avis adds that all vehicles are monitored in real time, with real-time positioning, speed, and route deviation.

The recall is over various defects found in the vehicles related to airbags, axles, batteries, and seatbelts. According to the NCC, the affected brands include Jeep Wrangler, Chrysler, Citroën, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, VW Polo and Sedan, and Volvo. This recall applies to specific car models under these brands that were manufactured between 2014 and 2016. According to Prudence Moilwa, head of complaints and investigations at the NCC, these recalls were initiated following notifications from suppliers, who are legally required to alert the Commission upon discovering a product defect. Moilwa explained that when suppliers discover a problem with a product, they have a responsibility to inform the commission. She stressed that the NCC’s role is to ensure the recall is successful and to protect consumer safety. However, the delay in issuing recalls—sometimes more than a decade after the vehicles were sold—has raised concerns. “It’s one of the issues that the Commission would like to engage with them on,” Moilwa said, adding that the NCC is setting up meetings with the manufacturers (OEMs) to understand the reason for the time lapse. In some cases, issues only emerge years after the vehicles have been on the road. “You might find that this issue only arises after the vehicle has been used for 10 years,” Moilwa noted. However, she added that safety concerns remain the manufacturer’s responsibility regardless of warranty status. “Once you create a vehicle and it is still on the road, it is still your responsibility to ensure safety.” The current recall relates to potentially defective airbags, possibly linked to the global Takata airbag scandal, which risk explosive deployment and could endanger occupants with flying debris. Moilwa compared the situation to the Ford Kuga recall, where manufacturing defects caused engine fires and led to a R35 million fine against Ford South Africa. As the NCC investigates further, consumers are encouraged to take their affected vehicles in for repairs immediately. “Book it in as soon as you can,” Moilwa said. While it’s too early to speak of compensation or refunds, she advised concerned consumers to lodge formal complaints if they no longer feel safe using their cars. The specific car models under the brands being recalled and the reasons for the recall are listed below, as outlined by the NCC. Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler 300c Stellantis South Africa informed the NCC that they are recalling the Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler 300c models due to a defect in the Takata airbag. According to the supplier, “the passenger airbag inflator may rupture, due to excessive internal pressure, during regular airbag deployment events. In the event of an inflator rupture, metal fragments could strike the vehicle occupants, resulting in serious injury or death.” These vehicles were available for sale from 2014 to 2016. Consumers must visit the nearest authorised dealership for an airbag repair or replacement. Jeep Wrangler Chrysler 300c Citroen C4, DS4, and DS5 Stellantis South Africa is recalling the Citroen C4, DS4 and DS5 models distributed from 2009 to 2016. These vehicles are being recalled due to a driver’s and passenger’s airbag inflator that may rupture during the airbag deployment phase. The potentially high energetic deployment of the inflator may lead to metal fragments detaching from the bursting inflator. It added that these parts could fly in the direction of the driver or occupants in the vehicle, capable of causing serious injury or possibly death in a worst-case scenario. Citroen C4 Citroen DS4 Citroen DS5 Mercedes-Benz CLA and S-Class Mercedes-Benz South Africa has notified the NCC that the length of the brake hoses on the rear axle might not have met the specifications of certain CLA (118 platforms) vehicles. The rear axle’s brake hoses might contact surrounding components, chafe over time, and subsequently leak brake fluid. According to the supplier, this will lead to reduced braking performance in one of the two brake circuits, increasing the risk of an accident caused by the brake fluid loss. The same is true for the S-Class (model series 223). Mercedes-Benz AG South Africa is recalling these vehicles due to a brake in the hoses on the front axle. After an extended operating period, the brake hoses may gradually start to leak in hot and moist areas. As a result, the brake fluid could leak out, impairing brake power in one of the two brake circuits and increasing the risk of an accident. The recalled vehicles were produced between 2020 and 2023. Mercedes-Benz CLA Mercedes-Benz S-Class 223 Series Audi e-tron GT Audi South Africa informed the NCC that they were recalling the Audi e-tron GT vehicles due to a high-voltage battery. “This is caused by some individual cell modules of the high-voltage battery that may display technical irregularities.” “The high-voltage battery may overheat, resulting in an acute fire hazard, with the associated risk of severe fatal injuries to people inside or outside the vehicle and significant property damage,” according to the supplier. A total of 46 affected vehicles were made available nationally. Consumers with affected vehicles should submit them to any Audi SA-approved Dealer for checking and module replacement if necessary. The affected cars were produced on 27 October 2021 onwards. Audi e-tron GT VW Polo Volkswagen of South Africa Limited notified the NCC that they were recalling the VW Polo Sedan. According to the supplier, the latch plates for the rear seat belt were produced with insufficient hardness. Therefore, in the event of powerful deceleration (accident or hard braking), “there may be a reduced retention or protective effect and related increased risk of injury.” From 2 April 2025 onwards, 905 affected vehicles were made available for sale nationally. Affected consumers are urged to contact an approved Volkswagen dealer for a check and, if necessary, replacement of the affected components. VW Polo Sedan Volvo XC90 Volvo Car South Africa is recalling 27 Volvo XC90 models (years 2020-2022) due to a potential issue with the high-voltage battery. According to the supplier, the issue may lead to overheating the battery cells when fully charged. The supplier added that in a worst-case scenario, overheating the high-voltage battery may lead to a thermal event. Consumers with affected vehicles are requested to book their cars into the nearest approved agents or dealerships for a check and to replace defective components where necessary.

According to Naamsa’s latest stats, new vehicle sales experienced double-digit growth in South Africa, although there are some pockets of decline, such as exports. The total number of new vehicles sold in the domestic market was 42,401, an increase of 11.9% (4,502 units) from the 37,899 cars sold in April 2024. The new passenger car market saw even bigger growth, with 30,101 new cars sold last month, representing an increase of 16.9% (4,350 vehicles) compared to the 25,751 new cars sold in April 2024. Despite the growth domestically, export sales declined, with only 31,822 units exported in April 2025, a decrease of 6.6% (2,266 units) compared to the 34,088 vehicles exported in April 2024. Overall, for the first quarter of 2024, Vehicle exports were still 6.3% ahead of the same period last year. “Even as external headwinds strengthened, the industry’s structural depth, export capabilities, and ability to pivot within a shifting global economy were fully on display,” said Naamsa. “The automotive sector finds itself once again at the coalface of global economic shifts,” added Naamsa CEO Mikel Mabasa. “While the new US tariff measures are concerning, the resilience and competitiveness of the South African automotive exports remain steadfast. Our industry has navigated difficult global tides before, and we will compellingly do so again.” On the back of optimistic sales numbers, WesBank highlighted that the data is even more encouraging considering April 2025 had fewer trading days than last year. “Year-on-year comparisons need to be contextualised in terms of selling days,” says Lebo Gaoaketse, Head of Marketing and Communication at WesBank. “April was disrupted by three public holidays and long weekends, resulting in only 19 selling days, whereas April 2024 had 21 selling days, given the public holidays fell into March last year.” Gaoaketse added that the market also appears to be correcting itself, balancing affordability with demand as consumers become more realistic about their purchase decisions. WesBank data shows that the average deal size shrank 8.6% year over year, indicating the stresses of affordability on new vehicle purchases and the continued trend of buying down into smaller, more affordable vehicles. “The competitive price point of new Chinese entrants will also influence this shift as consumers seek alternative value in the market.” Best-selling brands and cars Toyota remained the top-selling brand with 10,363 units sold last month, which is slightly lower than February’s 11,660 units. Suzuki maintained its position as the second most popular brand with 5,977 sales, while Volkswagen secured the third position on the list of top sellers last month with 3,973 sales. The top 10 brands that sold the most cars locally in April 2025 were: Toyota – 10,363 units Suzuki – 5,977 units Volkswagen Group – 3,973 units Hyundai – 3,007 units Ford – 2,398 units GWM – 1,943 units Chery – 1,852 units Isuzu – 1,383 units Renault – 1,281 units Mahindra – 1,278 units Gaoaketse noted that while April sales increased by 4,502 units compared to the previous year, the typical slower sales period at the beginning of the second quarter resulted in 7,059 fewer units sold than in March. He also warned that while local sales are not expected to be directly affected by policy decisions in the US in the short term, the situation will be different in the long term. Some US policy decisions will have longer-term effects on consumer and business sentiment. Gaoaketse said that this, along with any potential economic fallout impacting household budgets, could start to be felt later in the year. “For now, the South African new vehicle market is showing positive signs of growth momentum, which is beneficial for both consumers and the economy as a whole.” The best-selling cars under the brands listed above and how many were sold last month are listed below, as outlined by Naamsa. 1.

BMW, which also owns Mini and Rolls-Royce, moved into its South African headquarters in Midrand in 2015. The iconic building is located next to Pretoria Main Road and off the N1 Highway. It is close to Grand Central Airport and the Midrand stop on the Gautrain. About 600 associates work in the building, with diverse fields including marketing, human resources, business strategy, and example sales for the BMW brand, Mini and BMW Motorcycle. The main building in Midrand is part of an “open campus,” which also includes the offices of the Financial Services section and the on-site training centre. The group’s website states, “Our uniquely designed atrium garden invites you to take a moment of relaxation and reload your energy. “ The Green Building Council of South Africa awarded the building a 5-star rating in 2015 for its environmentally friendly features. The rating made BMW South Africa the first automotive company in South Africa to receive the rating. The rating considered the indoor environment quality, energy, transport, water, materials, land use, ecology, emissions, and innovations. Variables that added to Midrand HQ’s GBCSA 5-star rating included: Glass and solar-controlled louvres installed within the internal façade of the building, enabling enhanced daylight and thermal comfort. 90% of the office’s usable area now has an external view, providing good levels of daylight for occupants. The peak electrical demand on the building was reduced by 30%, which included an extensive use of LED lighting throughout the building. 5% of the parking bays are now dedicated to alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles, while 5% are reserved for motorbikes, mopeds and scooters. Water-efficient sanitary fittings were installed throughout the building. Water meters were installed for all major water uses and connected to a Building Management System to support proper facility management of water consumption. A dedicated storage area was provided for waste recycling, and All topsoil impacted by the construction was separated and protected from degradation, erosion, or mixing with fill or waste, and it still remains onsite. In addition to its Midrand headquarters, BMW has a manufacturing plant in Rosslyn, Pretoria, and an IT hub in Menlyn, Pretoria. A challenging time for the German company Despite its large presence in South Africa, the German car brand is facing a series of challenges. Over the last nine years, the brand reduced its dealership network in South Africa, dropping from 55 in 2015 to 46 in 2024. A BMW spokesperson said several factors contributed to the reduction in its dealership network, primarily the country’s challenging trading conditions. The group also added that it was scaling down to service-only operations and consolidating to achieve operating efficiencies. Apart from the operational changes, the increasing importance of affordability in South Africa is a major contributor to the decline. BMW said that the drop in vehicle sales over the period was partly driven by the exchange rate over the last decade. In 2013, the rand to US dollar was just over R10/$. Fast-forward twelve years, and the rand recently hit its worst-ever R19.93/$. “Therefore, all brands needed to increase vehicle prices above normal inflationary and production cost increases,” a BMW spokesperson said. “This has placed the premium segment into a new price bracket, encouraging a buying-down trend.” Images of the BMW HQ in Midrand Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

These proposals by the provincial government were published in the Provincial Gazette Extraordinary 9057 on 17 April 2025. In the Western Cape, licensing fees are expected to increase between 3.9% and 4.8%. For example, a car weighing between 750kg and 1,000kg has increased from R390 to R408 annually for a licence disc. This means the annual cost for a small hatchback is expected to be R408, while a large SUV like a Toyota Land Cruiser will cost R1,524. Despite the proposed increase, the Western Cape would still be the cheapest out of the three major metros for renewals, which include Gauteng and Durban. Motorists across South Africa, including the Western Cape, are subject to a 21-day grace period for renewing expired licences. Beyond this, penalties accrue at 10% of the annual fee for each month overdue. This rule highlights the financial burden of delaying renewals, making timely payments essential. This means, for example, a late renewal penalty of R40.80 per month if the licence lapses beyond the 21-day grace period for a hatchback in the Western Cape. As the costs of licencing fees for vehicles and drivers increase in South Africa and driving centres continue to experience inefficiencies, the conversation around digital driver and vehicle licences has gained traction. Road safety expert and Driving.co.za managing director Rob Handfield-Jones argues that South Africa should retire its physical licence cards and replace them with permanent, digital-only permits that never expire. “Every driver has fingerprints, and every vehicle has a VIN. If SARS can collect tax with an app, surely traffic officers could police drivers with an app,” said Handfield-Jones. Handfield-Jones added that the government would not consider an option that excluded a physical card because it would be a money-spinner for the state and possibly other vested interests. “There is no technological or practical obstacle to digital licensing and enforcement,” he said. “Rather, the problem is the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s refusal to give up the revenue streams that go with analogue document production.” The proposed fee increases will take effect on 1 August 2025 and are open for public comment until Saturday, 17 May 2025. The table below shows the price increases proposed for the Western Cape, depending on the relevant weight of the car. Tare Not exceeding Current fee Proposed fee % Change 750kg 1000kg R390 R408 +4.6% 1000kg 1250kg R462 R480 +3.9% 1250kg 1500kg R642 R672 +4.8% 1500kg 1750kg R708 R738 +4.2% 1750kg 2000kg R810 R846 +4.4% 2000kg 2250kg R1,104 R1,152 +4.4% 2250kg 2500kg R1,290 R1,350 +4.7% 2500kg 2750kg R1,446 R1,512 +4.6% 2750kg 3000kg R1,458 R1,524 +4.5% Reasons for the proposed increase “The Western Cape is home to over two million registered vehicles, and the condition of our roads is consistently rated among the best in the country,” the WCG said in a statement. “This is largely due to the provincial government’s commitment to ringfencing MVL revenue to maintain, upgrade, and expand our road network.” According to the Western Cape Mobility Department, paying vehicle licence fees is not just a legal requirement, it is essential to keeping roads safe, efficient, and reliable for everyone. “These fees are directly reinvested into the Western Cape’s road infrastructure, helping to build and maintain the roads that connect our communities, support economic activity, and enable daily life,” the department explained. It added that added that MVL fees are primarily used to build, upgrade, and maintain the provincially owned road network. They also assist municipalities in maintaining their more strategic roads and ensure continued safe mobility for all road users, including residents, freight operators, tourists, and public transport passengers. “The Western Cape’s road network is a vital provincial asset that supports commerce, tourism, service delivery and job creation,” the WCG said. By ensuring that our roads remain in optimal condition, the province safeguards economic competitiveness and enhances quality of life.” Western Cape residents are encouraged to review the draft regulation and submit comments before the closing date.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/822785/warning-for-south-africans-driving-these-hit-list-cars/,2026-01-18T00:17:04+00:00,,Warning for South Africans driving these ‘hit list’ cars,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 1 May 2025 Motoring Warning for South Africans driving these ‘hit list’ cars Malcolm Libera · 1 May 2025 South Africans who drive cars commonly targeted by hijackers are being warned to check that their insurance still covers them for theft and hijacking and that they are up to date with all requirements. This warning was flagged by consumer expert Wendy Knowler, who said that many drivers may be unaware that their theft and hijacking cover has been removed due to updated requirements from their insurers. “It’s not as simple as if your car is over a certain value. It goes very much on what the insurance statistics on theft and hijacking reveal regarding what models are on the thieves’ hit list,” she said in an interview with CapeTalk. According to Knowler, if you drive one of these high-risk vehicles, insurers may now require that you fit not one but two tracking devices of a specific technical standard to your car. “And if you don’t comply for whatever reasons, if you haven’t seen the email or whatever, they will just unilaterally cut your theft and hijacking cover from your cover,” she explained. She stressed the importance of awareness around this issue. “I feel quite strongly about this, and that’s why I want to get the word out.” Santam first noted this requirement in its Insurance Barometer report for the 2022/23 financial year, following record hijackings and vehicle theft claims in the country. Santam’s report noted that the experience was so poor that several corrective actions were needed to minimise exposure. These included doubling up on vehicle trackers, discussing tech-linked weaknesses with vehicle manufacturers, and promoting Faraday pouches to prevent the cloning of keyless access signals. Knowler cited an example of a 2023 letter sent by the insurer to clients, requiring certain vehicle owners, particularly those based in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, to install two tracking devices. She added that the requirements included that one must be an early warning tracker and a recovery system. The list included: All models of the Toyota Hilux from 2016 onward. All models of the Toyota Fortuner from 2016 onward. All models of the Toyota Prado from 2018 onward. Toyota Land Cruiser 200 models from 2017 onward. Lexus models from 2018 onward. It must be noted that the list could have since been amended, and that other insurers may have their own list, meaning this list could be incomplete. Make sure you’re covered To underscore the real-world impact, Knowler shared the story of a school principal who bought a Toyota Fortuner. The car, insured for the past five years, was stolen from a primary school in Rand Park about six weeks ago. The tracking device had been removed and left on the school grounds, but crucially, there was only one device. “Her claim was rejected because she had no cover for theft or hijacking for about two years previously, since March 2023, because she had not had a second tracking device fitted to that Fortuner,” said Knowler. “She’d been going around for two years, knowing she had one tracker and presuming that was fine.” That, said Knowler, is “the big issue here.” The principal said she wasn’t aware of the second tracking device requirement. “I’ve been operating based on the initial insurance policy we agreed upon,” she told Knowler. However, after investigating the matter, the principal discovered that the insurer had emailed her to inform her of the policy changes. The insurer sent her, presumably other affected policyholders, this email in November 2022, followed by a reminder 12 weeks later. These messages outlined the need to install a second tracking device or risk having theft and hijacking coverage removed from March 2023. The key takeaway is that if you own a high-risk vehicle, don’t assume you’re still fully covered. Check your insurance policy and ensure you meet all current requirements, especially regarding tracking devices. The latest statistics from the South African Police Service (SAPS) show that hijackings are still at alarming levels. The data shows that 4,807 hijackings were reported over the third quarter of 2024 (October to December), representing just over 53 incidents daily in the country.

In a statement published in April, Audi noted the premium automotive sector has faced significant pressures in recent years. The automaker added that these pressures include a notable buying-down trend driven by high inflation, rising interest rates and exchange rate weakness. “This has intensified both affordability pressures on the consumer side and pricing pressures on the manufacturer side,” said Audi. “This has prompted buyers to explore alternative options from new brand entrants primarily targeting the price-sensitive volume segment with well-equipped vehicles.” Audi highlighted that the lack of a regulatory framework and supportive incentive schemes from the South African government exacerbates these challenges. “This is in contrast to the support available for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in other developed countries, which could further enhance market growth,” said Audi. The impacts of these market shifts are evident in the shrinking premium vehicle segment in South Africa. This is illustrated in the data from Lightstone Auto, which shows the premium vehicle sector has contracted to nearly a third of its size compared to a decade ago. In 2014, luxury brands such as Audi, BMW, Mini, and Mercedes-Benz collectively sold around 74,015 vehicles in South Africa. As of the end of 2024, this number had dropped to 23,881. This translates to a 68% drop in sales, highlighting the staggering number of South Africans who no longer consider these vehicles an option. In response to this market evolution, Audi announced that it has proactively started implementing an “optimised footprint strategy in South Africa.” Audi failed to comment on how many of its dealerships in South Africa would be affected by the new strategy. However, the Motor Industry Staff Association (MISA) told Engineering News that it is aware of at least four Audi branches that will close in the coming months. Despite these shifts, Audi South Africa noted that it remains committed to adapting to market conditions while ensuring premium service delivery to its customers. Audi is not the only premium manufacturer affected by shifts in the South African market. BMW and Volvo have also reduced their dealerships or announced similar strategies. BMW Over the past nine years, the luxury German car brand BMW has slowly reduced its dealership network in South Africa. In 2015, BMW reported 55 dealerships in South Africa. However, as of the end of 2024, this number stands at 46, revealing the closure of nine dealerships over the period. A BMW spokesperson explained that multiple factors contributed to the 16% reduction in its dealership network. They explained that the main factors included the country’s current trading conditions, scaling down to service-only operations, and consolidation to achieve operating efficiencies. While all these reasons contributed to the reduction of its network, the increasing importance of affordability in South Africa’s market is also a major contributor. BMW further explained that the exchange rate significantly contributed to the reduction in vehicle sales over the period. In 2013, BMW noted that the Rand to US Dollar rate hovered around R10.20/dollar, compared to the current R18.26/dollar. “Therefore, all brands needed to increase vehicle prices above normal inflationary and production cost increases,” the BMW spokesperson said. “This has placed the premium segment into a new price bracket, encouraging a buying-down trend.” Volvo Volvo Cars South Africa (VCSA) has also confirmed that it plans to reduce its dealership network from 19 to just seven across the country. The manufacturer noted the move reinforces Volvo’s commitment to electrification, digitalisation, and sustainability, prioritising a premium and consistent service through strategically located, high-performing dealers. As for the remaining dealerships, VCSA confirmed that its vehicles will still be available at four dealership groups: CMH, SMH Bedfordview, Tom Campher Motors, and Rola Motors Somerset West. VCSA added that these retailers are strategically located in seven different areas across Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape. To determine which dealerships would be retained, VCSA conducted a nationwide evaluation throughout 2024, considering various factors vital to the brand, including sales potential. “The decision on which dealerships to close was based on those aspects as well as the sales potential for each location,” said VCSA. The closure dates for the affected dealerships are being finalised in discussions between Volvo and individual dealers. Customers will be notified accordingly. The company expects to complete the full restructuring process by the end of the second quarter of 2025.

Chery said that it will have 19 new models available across the hybrid (HEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and range-extender electric vehicle (REEV) categories. The first of these 19 cars were unveiled at Auto Shanghai 2025, where Chery launched its Super Hybrid brand, CSH. Chery’s history with hybrid technology dates back to 2001. Although hybrid technology was still a futuristic concept for most automakers at the time, Chery started its R&D journey from the ground up. Chery Chairman Yin Tongyue said the company’s hybrid technology strategy was driven by delivering four essentials: eco-friendly development, affordability, safety, and strong driving range. The company now has China’s fastest-growing hybrid segment, and the widest range of hybrid-equipped models in its global lineup. At Auto Shanghai 2025, the Tiggo 7 CSH, Tiggo 8 CSH, and Tiggo 9 CSH made their public debuts, all three of which are set to launch in South Africa. The next-generation CSH range will use an advanced hybrid engine boasting a record-breaking 46.5% thermal efficiency. The range can also be paired with a hybrid transmission offering 93% efficiency, leading to fuel consumption as low as 2 to 3 litres per 100 km. The dedicated 2.0 TGDI hybrid engine, combined with DHT230 and DHT280 transmissions, delivers up to 280 kw of total system output and a hybrid motor speed of 24,000 rpm. The CSH brand is designed for versatility, such as off-road conditions. The company said customer power solutions allow drivers to tackle everything from deserts to rugged terrain. The Super Hybrid Technology lineup of platforms includes the Super Hybrid Off-road Platform, Super Golden Extended-Range Platform, High-performance Electric Platform, and Super Hybrid Platform. “Advancing hybrid technology means harnessing innovation and new energy to drive sustainable growth and support a greener future,” said Jay Jay Botes, General Manager for Chery South Africa. “We believe Super Hybrid technology will become a key growth driver in markets like South Africa, especially as we expand our local lineup with electrified models later this year.” Chinese cars taking over South Africa Chinese auto manufacturers are making waves worldwide, and South Africa is no exception. Several new brands are expanding their operations in South Africa. The world’s largest automotive employer, BYD, recently announced that it will sell three new cars in the South African market, with prices ranging from R640,000 to R1.3 million. The new cars are the hybrid bakkie SHARK 6, the hybrid SUV SEALION 6, and the all-electric SEALION 7. The new cars expand BYD’s selection of models in the South African market to six. The brand already offers the BYD ATTO 3, DOLPHIN hatchback, and SEAL sedan in South Africa. Regarding new entrants, cars from Chinese-based Changan Automobile will soon be sold in South Africa via a partnership with Saudi Arabian-based Jameel Motors. Jameel Motors will distribute Changan and Deepal products, which are focused on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and new energy vehicles (NEVs), respectively. The Changan and Deepal cars should be available for purchase in South Africa in Q4 2025. Jameel Motors said that they are ideal for South Africa’s diverse terrain and road conditions. Additionally, MG recently returned to the South African market in January. The 100-year-old brand was founded in the UK, but joined SAIC Motor (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation) in 2007. The brand has come and gone in South Africa over the last few decades. It returned in 2011 but left again in 2016. When it returned in January, the company launched the MG ZS crossover, the MG HS SUV, and the MG Cyberster, an electric sports car. MG became China’s largest single-brand car exporter in 2019 and remains so. It produced 840,000 vehicles globally in 2023, and 88% of its sales occurred outside China.

In a trading statement for the six months ended 31 March 2025, WeBuyCars said that basic earnings will increase by more than 100% from a loss of R69 million to a gain of between R505.3 million and R508.8 million. Headline earnings should rise by over 100% from a loss of R69.5 million to a gain of between R506.5 million and R510.0 million. The group added that core headline earnings, its main way of measuring the business’s performance, increased by between 24% and 28% to between R500.2 million and R516.3 million. Core headline earnings are a non-IFRS measure that excludes gains/losses, costs, and adjustments relating to investment acquisitions and disposals; once-off transaction costs are directly attributable to corporate activity. The financial metric includes non-cash accounting adjustments to the call option derivative asset relating to non-controlling interests. The group noted that the over 83 million new shares issued on 29 February 2024, 27 March 2024, and 11 April 2024 had an unfavourable impact on the core headline, basic, and headline earnings per share. These new shares were issued under the group’s pre-listing phase, which shareholders approved before Webuycars’ listing on the JSE’s Main Board on 11 April 2024. The group noted no basic earnings per share of headline earnings per share adjustments in the six months ended 31 March 2025. That said, the following non-core, once-off transaction costs and non-cash call option derivative accounting adjustments impacted basic and headline earnings per share for the previous period: Pursuant to its successful listing on the JSE’s Main Board, the Company incurred a one-off professional, legal, and JSE listing fees totalling R45.0 million. The call option derivative asset of R426.5 million (as at 30 September 2023) relating to the pre-listing call options on the founders’ 25.1% shareholding in the group was derecognised on 25 March 2024. This fair value loss on derecognition of the call option derivative was once-off, non-core and had no cashflow impact. The financial results for the six months ended 31 March 2025 should be published on SENS on Monday, 19 May 2025.

Several motorists in South Africa have recently fallen victim to hijackers posing as police officers who stop unsuspecting drivers and rob them. These criminals are locally known as “blue-light gangs,” who confront drivers by setting up roadblocks or instructing them to pull over while claiming to be members of the Police Service or municipal police. The hijackers drive vehicles marked with police insignia or use flashing blue lights. They also wear police uniforms or display fake police appointment cards to deceive their victims. While there are cases of these gangs operating in multiple provinces, there has been a notable spike in incidents across Gauteng. The South African Police Service (SAPS) noted that five suspects were arrested on Wednesday (23 April) for the hijacking of a truck on Modderfontein Road in Sebenza. A police spokesperson added that the suspects were wearing Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department uniforms, while others were wearing South African Police Service reflector jackets. At the end of March, the SAPS also reported that more suspects were arrested in connection with a spate of hijackings on the N3 Highway between Villiers and De Hoek Toll Gate. The suspects were disguised as police officers, using a vehicle fitted with blue lights and sirens to pull over and hijack unsuspecting motorists. Additionally, the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) said it is currently investigating reports of individuals impersonating metro police officers. These criminals are conducting unauthorised traffic stops in areas such as Winnie Mandela Drive and Beyers Naudé Drive with the intention of hijacking vehicles. Superintendent Xolani Fihla emphasised the seriousness of these allegations and urged motorists to exercise caution. Fihla further warned motorists against stopping in isolated areas if they feel unsafe and advised them to proceed to the nearest police station to verify the credentials of the officers stopping them. He added that motorists can contact the JMPD or the South African Police Service (SAPS) if they doubt officers’ legitimacy. “If you are stopped by individuals claiming to be JMPD officers, request to see their official JMPD identification card,” said Fihla. “Motorists can also take note of the vehicle’s registration number, make and model, and try to remember any distinguishing features of these individuals.” He urged South Africans who have been victims or witnessed suspicious activity to report it to the JMPD immediately. The cars targeted CEO of Fidelity Group Wahl Bartmann Regarding the most popular cars among hijackers, security experts have explained that vehicle hijackings are primarily business-driven by demand and supply in South Africa. The CEO of Fidelity Group Wahl Bartmann previously told BusinessTech that popular models are targeted due to the high demand for their parts or resale value, often through illicit markets. For years, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford cars have been the most targeted vehicles, which still holds true. However, the rise of Chinese automakers in the South African market has introduced new targets. Fidelity ADT first flagged this in mid-last year. Fidelity did not specify vehicle models. However, trends and sales data from Naamsa indicate that the Haval Jolion and Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, top sellers at the end of 2024, are likely hijacking targets. Larger SUVs like the Haval H6 and Chery Tiggo 7 Pro are also at risk due to their popularity. These vehicles join the list of favourites among hijackers, which includes: VW Polo Toyota Hilux Ford Ranger Toyota Corolla Cross Toyota Fortuner Haval Jolion Chery Tiggo 4 Pro Haval H6 Chery Tiggo 7 Pro Bartmann further noted that popular models are often targeted because they blend in easily on South African roads, especially in colours like white and silver. Hijackers typically strip these cars for parts or re-register them through corrupt channels for resale. According to the SAPS’ latest crime statistics, cases of hijackings have declined significantly over the past year. The data shows that hijacking incidents have decreased by 19.5% in the country over the third quarter of 2024 (October to December). However, this is little to celebrate, and the number of hijackings being reported in South Africa remains alarmingly high. According to the SAPS report, 4,807 hijackings were reported over the period, which represents just over 53 incidents every day in the country.

It will undergo a brief shutdown as it prepares to build a new car. In 2024, the Volkswagen Group South Africa-owned Kariega plant became the sole global production hub for the Polo. Kariega is the assembly and shipping location for all Polo versions, including the GTI. The plant also produces the more affordable Polo Vivo. The automaker ended production of the hatchback in Pamplona, Spain, last year as it transitions to focusing on affordable electric vehicles starting early 2026, making Kariega the sole worldwide supplier. Although a specific version of the Polo, the Polo Track, is manufactured in Brazil for the South American market, the standard Polo is still only made in South Africa and shipped to Europe and Asia. In South Africa, the Polo Vivo’s success is clear in its annual vehicle sales, with it claiming second spot overall with close to 26,000 sales in 2024. Only the Toyota Hilux’s 33,000 sales beat the Polo Vivo. Despite being the only site in the world that now manufactures the Polo, the Kariega plant is currently in a four-week shutdown. The production cease will allow the group to install and upgrade facilities across its production areas in preparation for making a new third model. Vehicle production of the Polo and Polo Vivo has been halted from 14 April to 12 May, allowing VW’s team to perform the necessary work on the line in areas such as Body Shop, Paint Shop and Final Assembly. The planned work also builds on the installations performed in December 2024 during the plant’s annual shutdown. Roughly 60% of the required changes were finished over the initial 25 days of shutdown in December, including the installation of seven new robots; The completion of the remaining 40% will also mark the start of the commissioning phase of the A0 SUV Entry project. Preparations for the third model were announced in February 2024, when the VW Group Africa announced a R4 billion upgrade at the factory. The production team is working closely with Brazilian counterparts for the launch of the mew model, and has even invited customers across Africa to help select the name of the new model. “This project is understandably a very exciting one for us,” said VWGA Production Director Ulrich Schwabe. “I firmly believe this new vehicle will be just as iconic as the beloved Polo and Vivo we are already building.” Volkswagen upgrades cars in South Africa Apart from planning to producing a new car in South Africa, VW also made several additions to its product lineup available to consumers in the first few months of 2025. This includes a new upgrade of the eighth-generation model of the Golf that launched in 2021. The VW Golf’s history in South Africa dates back to 1978 with the launch of the first generation MK1, which gained acclaim for its reliability and performance. As it was previously built at Kariega, it became a popular and affordable car with South African customers. The eighth-generation Golf model was launched in 2021. However, it did not come with the venerable and efficient 1.4 TSI engine variant. The upgraded model has a 1.4 TSI engine producing 110 kw, a next-generation infotainment system, and a sharper front and rear end design. The price of the new Golf starts at R580,900. The group also introduced the VW Crafter 50 Range. The new and improved delivery truck starts from R991,000. VW also expanded the new Tiguan model lineup by adding two new engines: a 2.0 TDI with 110 kw and a 2.0 TSI with 140 kw. Between its local launch in August 2024 and February 2025, the new Tiguan sold over 1,000 units in South Africa. The new version with the upgraded 2.0 TDI starts at R770,800, while the 2.0 TDI will set customers back at least R851,500.

The two companies are strong contenders for the assets that are valued at about $1 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Previous potential bidders including Trafigura’s Puma Energy, Sasol Ltd. and South Africa’s PetroSA are no longer in the running, two of the people said. “While Adnoc Distribution regularly reviews opportunities for domestic and international growth, we don’t comment on market speculation,” Adnoc’s fuel retail unit said. Shell, Gunvor, Trafigura and Sasol declined to comment. PetroSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Shell has been looking to offload the assets, which include about 600 fuel stations and trading operations in Africa’s biggest economy, as part of a broader strategy to focus on regions and businesses that offer higher returns. The assets are attractive for trading firms since they ensure demand for fuels that they can then supply. Adnoc and other Middle East oil companies such as Saudi Aramco have been expanding their trading arms as they look to break into new markets. Shell is working with adviser Rothschild & Co and a winner could be announced in the coming weeks, the people said. Talks are continuing and there’s no certainty there will be a final sale, they said. Saudi Aramco has also been involved in the process, but it wasn’t immediately clear if it was still in the running, the people said. Aramco declined to comment. A deal would give the buyer about 10% of South Africa’s fuel stations. The market in the country has changed significantly in recent years with trader Glencore Plc acquiring Chevron Corp.’s Caltex-branded stations a few years back. Ttrader Vitol Group’s Vivo Energy last year bought Engen Ltd., the African nation’s largest petrol station chain. Shell itself sold South Africa’s largest refinery to the state-owned Central Energy Fund after the oil major had stopped processing there in 2022.

Uber said these new restrictions aim to make every trip go smoothly and help manage comfort, space, and safety, especially when luggage is involved. “Please know that this guidance is advisory. If you feel unsure, we recommend that you contact the driver to confirm, as it would depend on the vehicle,” it said. Luggage is permitted with all Uber rides, including Uber Go, Uber X, Uber Comfort, Uber Black, Uber XL, and Uber Van. Uber Go is restricted to 2 passengers, whereas Uber X, Uber Comfort, and Uber Black are limited to 3 passengers. Groups with more than three people should use Uber XL, which can take six passengers, or Uber Van, which can accommodate seven passengers. This announcement followed the launch of Uber Moto which offers South Africans trips on the back of a motorbike. “Uber Moto is your new two-wheel alternative to getting around the Western Suburbs of the Joburg CBD,” the company said in a press statement. “You can request one seat only with Uber Moto.

Traffic authorities are expected to be out in full force over the Easter holiday season, with increased roadblocks and patrols looking out for violations. Along with the December holidays, the Easter holiday season is a peak traffic period on South Africa’s roads, which increases the risks of road accidents. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, the most fatal road accidents over the Easter weekend occur after sunset, with nearly 95% of accidents caused by human factors. This includes drunk driving. One of the key ways authorities try to mitigate accidents is by setting up roadblocks and visible policing to ensure that drivers are not breaking any traffic laws and that cars are roadworthy. Kirstie Haslam, Partner at DSC Attorneys urged South Africans to know their legal rights when stopped at a roadblock to ensure a smooth and lawful interaction. South Africans must present valid driver’s licence and provide identification details if requested at a roadblock as per Section 13(8) of the South African Police Service Act. Officers can search vehicles and individuals without a warrant and confiscate any illegal goods found. “If detained or arrested, you have the right to legal representation and should not be questioned without your lawyer present if one is requested,” said Haslam. She also provided a survival checklist for roadblocks: Pull over safely when signalled. Stay calm and respectful. Comply with instructions and avoid confrontation. Sign fines or infringement notices calmly – roadside arguments only escalate the situation. Never offer a bribe. Bribery is a criminal offence. Know your rights and be aware of legal boundaries, which could prevent potential abuses of power. Check your vehicle. Ensure roadworthiness and that your licence and registration are up to date. Haslam added that motorists cannot be forced to pay outstanding fines on the spot , as this is extortion. An arrest is only lawful if an officer shows a valid warrant. Officers can issue a summons with a court date at least 14 days away, excluding Sundays and public holidays. “If a warrant is presented, you may be detained until payment is made. If not, request to call your attorney immediately.” When it comes to drinking and driving, motorists cannot refuse a breathalyser without reasonable cause. If they are over the legal limit of 0.05g/dl, they’ll be taken for a blood test. Haslam said that one should ensure that the tester uses sterile equipment. You may also call your doctor to see if they can arrive on time. “Blood must be drawn within two hours of being stopped; expired test kits invalidate results, and a police officer must be present when your blood is taken”. “If arrested, you must be informed of your rights immediately and detained at the nearest police station,” she explains. “You must be brought to court within 48 hours and can apply for bail unless the charge is serious.” Haslam added that unlawful arrests and police brutality remain a concern. Drivers may have a personal injury claim against the SAPS or municipal police if they experience wrongful detention or excessive force. If this is the case, they should act quickly to ensure legal time limits, collect evidence like officers’ names, witness details, medical reports and photos of the injuries, and engage with a lawyer, she said. Make sure your car is ready to hit the road Before leaving for holiday, drivers must ensure their vehicle is safe and roadworthy. Gary Stieger, founder and MD of My Glass, said motorists should get their cars serviced, check tyres, and have wheels aligned before going on a long trip. He also said that they should check the state of their windscreen, as a minor chip can refract light and impair visibility. It could also lead to a much larger crack if the vehicle drives over bumpy roads. Marius Kemp, Head of Personal Lines Underwriting at Santam, added that drivers should have all their paperwork and licensing in order before departing. Motorists should decide beforehand where to take their rest breaks, as tiredness and a lack of concentration can lead to accidents. Motorists should also check news streams for traffic updates and have a road-side SOS number at hand. They should also stock their emergency supply by investing in a first-aid kit to help with road trip headaches like motion sickness and cuts. A torch, glow-in-the-dark triangles, plenty of water, and wet wipes are always good things to carry with you in the car.

According to the latest Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) from Stats SA, the average salary in South Africa increased by 5.3% year-on-year to R28,231 in the fourth quarter of 2024. The QES highlighted that the average salary has dropped by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter from the revised estimate of R28,274 in Q3 2024. However, the 5.3% year-on-year increase is higher than the average inflation for 2024 (4.4%), meaning salaries have increased in real terms year over year . The Q4 data covers the final quarter of 2024, ending December. The QES represents data for South Africa’s formal non-agricultural job market. Over the period, gross earnings paid to employees increased by R59.1 billion or 6.1% from R969.4 billion in September 2024 to R1.03 trillion in December 2024. Stats SA said this was due to increases in trade, manufacturing, community services, business services, construction, transport and electricity. Year-on-year gross earnings increased by R35.5 billion or 3.6% between December 2023 and December 2024. The boost in earnings over the period was driven mainly by bonuses, reflecting the end-of-year period where these rewards are paid out. Basic salaries and wages paid to employees increased by only 1.1% or R9.5 billion over the period, though in line with inflation year-on-year, up 4%. Bonuses, meanwhile, were up by R51.8 billion or 85.4% from the prior quarter—up 3.2% year on year from December 2023. Stats SA said that while overall earnings are rising, the latest figures highlight a labour market experiencing growth and disparities, with some sectors thriving while others struggle to keep pace. The statistics body noted that while recent figures show short-term increases in both full-time and part-time employment, the overall labour market still faces challenges, especially compared to last year’s performance. Cars you can afford on the average salary Financing experts advise that individuals should allocate no more than 25% of their monthly income to vehicle-related expenses. For someone earning an average salary of R28,231, this translates to a budget of R7,058 per month for car costs, including instalments, insurance, and fuel. Given this guideline, the portion allocated solely to car repayments for this article is capped at R5,000 per month. At a prime lending rate of 11% over 60 months with no deposit or balloon payment, this cap equates to a maximum car price of roughly R260,000. While 17 new cars remain within reach of this budget, the list is shrinking as vehicle prices continue to climb. Exchange rate fluctuations, for instance, have made imported vehicle components significantly more expensive. Coupled with supply chain disruptions, manufacturers face higher production costs, which are inevitably passed on to consumers. Considering this, there are currently only 17 cars priced under R260,000 in South Africa. These are listed below with pricing and estimated monthly repayment amounts.

Launched in 2018 by North, Alex Thomson and Sumarié Greybe, Naked sells insurance products via a fully digital platform that uses AI and automation. Its app allows customers to obtain final insurance quotes in under 90 seconds, buy cover online, submit claims or pause accident coverage without phone calls. It has grown rapidly because it sells 100% of its car, home and single-item insurance policies without human intervention. It recently raised $38 million (about R700 million) in its latest Series B2 funding round, which it will use in its expansion plans. The funding round included funds from impact investor Global Impact Investor BlueOrchard and existing funders Hollard, Yellowwoods, the IFC, and Germany’s development finance institution. North has, however, warned South African motorists about several habits that can hurt their car’s resale value. When selling a car, South Africans want to get the best price possible. However, many people make mistakes that devalue their cars. This means that many get less money in their pockets when they sell or trade their car in. Skipping services and maintenance Servicing your car each year or taking it in for repairs when warning lights come on may seem expensive. However, small issues can quickly turn into big, expensive problems. Buyers will pay more for a vehicle that has been well-maintained and has a full-service history. Using authorised dealers and RMI-approved workshops for services and repairs will also boost a buyer’s confidence in a car. Missing services may also invalidate a warranty, meaning that you won’t be covered for any large repairs. It could also hurt your insurance claims. If accidents are linked to neglect, such as brake failure, an insurer might refuse to pay your claim because the accident could have been via reasonable care. Not fixing small dents and scratches Although a small scratch on a door or a dent on a bumper might not seem like a big deal, leaving these imperfections unattended could reduce one’s car’s resale value down the line. A minor scratch can lead to rust or corrosion, decreasing a car’s value and leading to additional repair costs. “It can also create the impression you’re not looking after your car. Even if it’s inconvenient and costly, try to get dents and scratches repaired as soon as they happen,” said North. Another tip for those with car insurance is to consider whether the repair cost is higher than your excess and if the cost justifies risking your no-claims bonus. If another insured driver caused the damage to your car, your insurer should be able to help you claim against them. Losing the Paperwork Documentation, including service records, repair invoices, and the vehicle’s handbook, is also key and increases a buyer’s confidence in one’s car. The buyer will believe that the car has been taken good care of and that the seller is transparent about its history. Adding aftermarket modifications Several modifications will turn off potential buyers and decrease a car’s resale value. This is particularly true of aftermarket parts that can change one’s car’s style or performance. Those who modify their car should keep the original parts so they can return it to its factory state when it’s time to sell. Moreover, those with customisations should let their insurer know. If they don’t, these changes to your car could lead to the insurer denying your claim if there’s an accident. These modifications could also lead to higher insurance premiums or even a complete denial of coverage. Neglecting TLC People should also take care of their cars by keeping them clean on the inside and outside to preserve their appearance and value. Leaving it exposed to the elements is a bad idea, as sun damage, rust, faded or cracked interior finishings, and half-dents can all hurt its value. Those who don’t park it under cover for any reason should invest in a quality car cover for added protection. “Maximising your car’s resale value doesn’t require magic; it’s about care, maintenance, and a bit of savvy,” said North. “By breaking these habits, you’ll not only enjoy a more reliable ride while you own it, but also ensure you’ll get the best possible price for your car when it’s time to sell.” Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Property · 2h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 5h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 8h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 23h New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Finance · 24h Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 1d New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses 5 Things · 16 Jan 2026 One of South Africa’s richest families receives over R1 billion in Capitec shares, and blow for DStv owner Business · 16 Jan 2026 Storm brewing over Mr Price deal to buy European retailer for R9.7 billion Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

These were some of the comments that Volkswagen Group Africa chair and MD Martina Biene made during a National Automobile Dealers’ Association (Nada) event in March. She explained that local car makers are undervalued in South Africa. They have little protection from cheaper imports and must pay the cost of government failures to remain operational. The challenges Biene mentioned include the additional costs imposed on manufacturers due to unreliable electricity supply, inefficient transport and logistics, and operational difficulties at the country’s ports. These locally unique costs have made it difficult to compete with cheap imports from Asia, which don’t face the same challenges, creating an unfair playing field. “That is not correct, and we don’t price because of our margin,” she said, explaining that South Africa’s relatively low production volumes put local manufacturers at a disadvantage. “Volkswagen only manufactures 27,000 Vivos a year in South Africa, whereas other cars in the segment are produced in countries where 300,000 to 400,000 vehicles are manufactured annually, benefiting from economies of scale.” These mass-produced vehicles enter the small South African domestic market at highly competitive prices, making it difficult for Volkswagen and others to compete. “That is not right,” Biene said. To try to claw back some of the budget segment market share, VW is planning to manufacture and introduce more budget models to the local market. Volkswagen Group Africa announced in April 2024 that it would invest R4 billion in its Kariega plant in the Eastern Cape to prepare for the manufacture of a budget-friendly SUV. This new SUV will be what’s known in other markets as the Tera, although it will likely be called something different for the South African market. It’s been reported that this model will be based on the popular Polo and will be below the imported T-Cross in terms of dimensions and price. Future of the VW Polo Vivo questioned To prepare for the production of this new model, Biene said the Kariega plant will be closed for a month starting in mid-April for a major refurbishment. Interestingly, Biene confirmed that Volkswagen Group Africa is in the process of putting together a business case for another new model, but she did not provide further details. However, if successful, Moneyweb reported that it appears it could lead to the discontinuation of Vivo production, with Biene saying, “I don’t know if we can run the Vivo for as long as we ran the Citi Golf.” This is not the first time the continuation of Volkswagen’s budget Polo Vivo hatchback has come into question. Last year, during a Q&A held at VW’s Polo factory in Kariega (formerly Uitenhage), TopAuto reported that company representatives mentioned that the Vivo “will stick around so long as there is demand for it.” This comment was followed up with a remark that the Vivo should remain on the market until at least 2030 but that its future past this point is unclear. However, with 27,000 Vivos manufactured over a year and increasing competition from cheaper imports, the Vivo’s lifespan may be cut short, although nothing is set in stone. For now, the Vivo remains part of VW’s lineup in South Africa. The Polo Vivo was introduced in 2010 as a successor to the long-standing Citi Golf. Positioned as a more affordable alternative to the Polo, it quickly became popular due to its value for money, reliability, and practicality. Fast-forward to 2024, Volkswagen unveiled a refreshed Polo Vivo, with prices starting at R266,600 and climbing to R356,000 for the range-topping model. In 2025, the price of the VW Polo Vivo hatchback ranges from R271,900 to R363,100. At the current starting price, 20 cars from several brands sold in South Africa are now cheaper than the Vivo. These numbers indicate the aggressive competition from Asia, with 16 out of the 20 models coming from nine brands imported from Asia.

In 2015, BMW reported 55 dealerships in South Africa. However, as of the end of 2024, this number stands at 46, revealing the closure of nine dealerships over the period. A BMW spokesperson explained to TopAuto that multiple factors contributed to the 16% reduction in its dealership network. They explained that the main factors included the country’s current trading conditions, scaling down to service-only operations, and consolidation to achieve operating efficiencies. While all these reasons played a part in the reduction of its network, sales numbers and the increasing importance of affordability in South Africa’s market seem to be major contributors. Due to economic headwinds over the past decade, prospective vehicle owners have turned away from luxury cars to more affordable alternatives that offer better value for money, such as cars from Asia. Sales numbers over the last ten years show a declining demand for luxury cars in favour of cheaper alternatives in South Africa. Data compiled from Lightstone show that BMW reported 24,521 sales in 2014, a number that fell 51% to 11,989 by the end of 2024. The data also revealed that other luxury brands, such as Mercedes-Benz and Audi, haven’t been spared from the decline either, with both showing worse sales numbers than BMW. The biggest loser was Mercedes-Benz, which dropped 82% to 5,048 sold units in 2024 from 28,993. Audi followed, with a 70% decline in sales over the same period. In contrast, vehicles from Asia—such as Chery, Haval, and Suzuki—have seen massive growth over the same period. In 2014, these three car brands collectively sold 8,127. This has increased by a whopping 1,000% to 89,416 in 2024. Suzuki saw a 776% increase in sales, Chery saw a 1,435% increase, and Haval experienced a remarkable 3,029% increase. BMW X3 The National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) told BusinessTech that this trend is due to the price-sensitivity shift in the South African market over the years. “The South African vehicle market is increasingly price-sensitive, with affordability remaining a challenge due to high inflation, interest rates and fuel costs,” said NADA. “Most buyers are now shopping in the sub-R350,000 range, where Chinese brands offer strong perceived value at an accessible price point.” BMW further explained that a big contributing factor to the reduction in vehicle sales over the time period was the exchange rate. In 2013, BMW noted that the Rand to US Dollar rate hovered around R10.20/dollar, compared to the current R18.26/dollar. “Therefore, all brands needed to increase vehicle prices above normal inflationary and production cost increases, which also placed the premium segment into a new price bracket, encouraging a buying-down trend,” the BMW spokesperson said. “For BMW South Africa, our business model has stabilised over the past five years, and we have shown two consecutive years of growth.” BMW is not the luxury brand to have closed dealerships across South Africa as Volvo has also announced plans to conduct a “review” of its local dealership network. At the end of February, the company announced it would conduct a strategic dealer network restructuring in South Africa. Volvo noted that the restructuring is part of its strategy to align with global trends and enhance customer experience. It focuses on electrification, digitalisation, and sustainability. The company hasn’t disclosed the finer details of the reshuffling, but the expectation is that it will include a noticeable reduction in the number of dealers. While no details were given about the number of dealerships that will be impacted by the review, MSN reported that multiple sources indicated that the total will be cut from 19 to just seven new vehicle sales facilities. These remaining facilities are said to only cover the country’s three major metropolitan areas, including Joburg, Cape Town, and Durban.

At the end of February, the company announced it would conduct a strategic dealer network restructuring in South Africa. Volvo noted that the restructuring is part of its strategy to align with global trends and enhance customer experience. It focuses on electrification, digitalisation, and sustainability. It said that the move will involve consolidating and optimising existing dealerships rather than expanding, focusing on strategically located, high-performing dealers that can offer a consistent premium experience. The company hasn’t disclosed the finer details of the reshuffling, but the expectation is that it will include a noticeable reduction in the number of dealers. In a statement to News24, a spokesperson for VCSA said while the plan has not been finalised, it “has been actively consulting with its independent licensed dealers. Any dealers affected by the review will independently evaluate their operational position and commercial strategy. No details were given about any potential job losses and how many dealerships will be impacted by the review. However, MSN reported that multiple sources indicated that the total will be cut from 19 to just seven new vehicle sales facilities, covering only the country’s three major metropolitan areas, including Joburg, Cape Town and Durban. Additionally, two dealership representatives told IOL that the Volvo Cars head office had already collected vehicles from their facilities ahead of the agreed-upon closure dates, leaving them with empty showrooms. Despite this, VCSA said it remains committed to a transparent and fair process in all its discussions with independent dealers. The company also added that while we have plans to resize our dealer network locally, Volvo remains fully committed to the South African market. “This commitment is evident in the continued investment in electrified mobility and the introduction of new models,” it said. The company reaffirmed that existing warranty and service contracts will remain unaffected by the dealer restructuring and that all customers will continue to be serviced adequately. Move criticised by major union VCSA noted that restructuring its business is part of its goal of becoming the leader in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. The automotive landscape is shifting globally, and South Africa is no exception. The rise of New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) is driven by several factors, including environmental concerns and the call for cleaner transportation. Other motivating factors are fuel price volatility, stricter emission regulations, and advances in battery technology, electric motors, and charging infrastructure. According to Naamsa data, NEV sales in 2024 showed significant growth, with a total of 15,611 units sold in the year. This accounts for 3% of the total new vehicle market, a notable increase over the 1.47% market share of 2023. As technology advances, charging infrastructure expands, and more affordable models are introduced, NEVs will be seen increasingly as a viable mobility option by car buyers in South Africa. However, regardless of the reasons, the Motor Industry Staff Association (MISA) has condemned Volvo Cars South Africa’s decision to restructure its operations in the country. MISA CEO Martlé Keyter said VCSA failed to notify the union, representing more than 66% of its employees, of its planned restructuring in terms of section 189 of the Labour Relations Act. “The Act clearly states that an employer must consult with the relevant union when contemplating possible dismissals as a result of restructuring,” she said. “It is a shame that employees at Volvo Cars South Africa had to read that restructuring could impact a significant number of dealerships.” Keyter also noted that the announcement caused panic and anxiety among MISA’s more than 700 members, who had not informed the union before the announcement. “Our members can rest assured that the union’s legal department will ensure that Volvo Cars South Africa follows the correct process. “The union will participate in a joint consensus-seeking process attempting to minimise the envisaged resizing of the dealer network,” Keyter said. BusinessTech contacted Volvo Cars South Africa for an update on their restructuring plans but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Ford Africa president Neale Hill has expressed concerns over South Africa’s ongoing infrastructure inefficiencies, particularly in transport and logistics, which are significantly impacting local carmakers and their ability to remain competitive. Speaking to Business Day , Hill pointed to the country’s struggling transport infrastructure, stating that Transnet’s inefficiencies are creating significant hurdles for automotive manufacturers. “We’re still mostly moving vehicles by road, and we’re too heavily reliant on Durban as a port,” Hill said. The increased dependence on road freight due to unreliable rail services raises costs and slows production, making South African-made vehicles less competitive globally. “Load-shedding, while less frequent, has been replaced by another major concern—logistics bottlenecks.” Years of underinvestment in Transnet’s rail and port systems have led to costly delays in moving vehicles and components. Despite some improvements in the rail corridor between Gauteng and Durban, Hill said Ford is still forced to rely on trucking its vehicles along the N3 freeway. Ford’s Silverton plant produces approximately 640 to 660 Ranger units daily, with 65% destined for export. However, South Africa’s rail freight, which should be a cost-saving advantage, remains as expensive as road transport—unlike in other countries where rail is typically 30% cheaper. Hill warned that these issues threaten future investments. “South Africa competes with plants around the world to assemble cars, and these factors come into play when multibillion-rand decisions are made about future investments in the country,” he said. If the country continues to struggle with transport logistics, foreign investors may start looking elsewhere for production opportunities. Ford is one of seven original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) producing cars in South Africa, contributing around 5% to South Africa’s GDP. The others include BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Isuzu, Toyota, and Volkswagen, with Stellantis and Mahindra planning to establish local factories. Other carmakers have similar concerns Ford Africa president Neale Hill Ford’s concerns echo those of Volkswagen Group Africa chair and MD Martina Biene, who also raised alarms over the deteriorating business conditions for car manufacturers in South Africa. Speaking at a National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) event, Biene highlighted how local carmakers are burdened with additional costs due to government failures while struggling to compete with cheap imports. Biene pointed out Volkswagen’s significant investment in backup power solutions at its Kariega facility to mitigate the effects of an unreliable power supply. “We now have two generators that cost R130 million because we need quite a bit of power, but every day I run those generators, it costs R1.6 million,” Biene said. These expenses, she added, ultimately get passed on to consumers, making locally produced cars more expensive. She further stressed that South Africa’s position as a competitive vehicle manufacturing destination is under threat. “There are 117 Volkswagen plants in the world, and that is my biggest competition in the market,” Biene said, adding that infrastructure failures and high operating costs make it difficult for the local plant to secure future investment. Beyond electricity concerns, Biene also pointed to transport and logistics as significant deterrents to new investment. Like Hill, she criticised the inefficiencies in South Africa’s ports and rail systems, which drive up costs and cause significant delays. These challenges, coupled with an influx of cheap imports from Asia, put local manufacturers at a disadvantage. Volkswagen employs around 4,000 people in South Africa but faces increasing competition from brands that import vehicles at much lower costs, contributing little to the country’s economy. According to Biene, manufacturers in countries such as China benefit from heavy government subsidies, allowing them to price their vehicles more competitively. In contrast, South African carmakers must absorb additional costs caused by government inefficiencies, making it increasingly difficult to compete. Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) CEO Andrew Kirby has also raised similar concerns, particularly about the surge in Chinese vehicle imports and its impact on local production. While competition is generally welcomed, Kirby argues that the rapid influx of imported vehicles creates an uneven playing field and accelerates de-industrialisation. As a result of the increase in cheap imports, he noted that South Africa’s vehicle production has been significantly affected in recent years. Historically, Kirby explained that local factories assembled cars using parts from domestic suppliers, a process known as Completely Knocked Down (CKD) production. “This approach is critical for job creation and economic growth. However, since 2018, CKD production in South Africa has declined by more than 11%,” he said. “Instead, more vehicles are being imported as fully built units, particularly from Asia, which reduces local job opportunities and investment in the manufacturing sector.” Kirby linked this trend to South Africa’s Automotive Production Development Programme (APDP), specifically Chapter 98, which provides free trade rebates and semi-knocked-down (SKD) options, making importing vehicles more attractive than local assembly. “For South Africa’s car industry to succeed, we need to focus on growing CKD production and using more locally made parts,” Kirby said.

They have little protection from cheaper imports and must pay the cost of government failures to remain operational. This, in turn, hurts investment in South Africa’s motor manufacturing industry and ultimately costs consumers more. Speaking at a National Automobile Dealers’ Association (Nada) event this past week, Volkswagen Group Africa chair and MD Martina Biene outlined the company’s significant challenges in South Africa. This includes the additional costs imposed on manufacturers due to unreliable electricity supply, inefficient transport and logistics, and operational difficulties at the country’s ports. Biene highlighted Volkswagen’s recent investment in generators at its Kariega facility to mitigate the impact of an inconsistent power supply. These are additional costs that manufacturers shouldn’t bear, which invariably detriment consumers. “We now have two generators that cost R130 million because we need quite a bit of power, but every day I run those generators, it costs R1.6 million,” Biene explained. She noted that this was a direct cost of doing business in Nelson Mandela Bay, and the company would not recover these costs. “That is added to the pricing of cars because that money must come from somewhere,” she said. Compounding the issue is that these additional expenses are not just an issue for Volkswagen but extend to other manufacturers and sectors on which local car production relies. Earlier this year, automotive component makers and vehicle manufacturers, including Volkswagen and Toyota, called on the government to intervene in steel giant ArcelorMittal South Africa’s (AMSA) planned shutdown. The concern was that AMSA’s closure would disrupt supply chains, threaten localisation efforts, and potentially lead to de-industrialisation. Despite these warnings, AMSA moved ahead with its decision to shut mills, citing similar challenges such as electricity shortages, transport inefficiencies, and regulatory red tape. Volkswagen and other local manufacturers contribute significantly to South Africa’s economy through job creation, skills development, and transformation. The company employs 4,000 people, yet it faces intense competition from imported vehicles from brands that contribute very little to the country’s economy. Volkswagen Chairperson and Managing Director Martina Biene. Biene pointed out that Volkswagen is the only local manufacturer producing a model in the small car segment, yet imported vehicles—often significantly cheaper—dominate the market. “That is not correct, and we don’t price because of our margin,” she said, explaining that South Africa’s relatively low production volumes put local manufacturers at a disadvantage. “Volkswagen only manufactures 27,000 Vivos a year in South Africa, whereas other cars in the segment are produced in countries where 300,000 to 400,000 vehicles are manufactured annually, benefiting from economies of scale.” These mass-produced vehicles enter the small South African domestic market at highly competitive prices, making it difficult for Volkswagen and others to compete. “That is not right,” Biene said. Biene first raised concerns about these systemic disadvantages at the South African Auto Week in Cape Town last year, warning that the high cost of production in South Africa threatens the long-term sustainability of local manufacturers. She reiterated that Volkswagen’s substantial investment in generators at its Kariega plant highlights the cost burden local manufacturers face. “Volkswagen globally will not understand a situation where we don’t have power, which hinders me from putting forward a strong business case,” Biene said. “There are 117 Volkswagen plants in the world, and that is my biggest competition in the market.” Beyond electricity constraints, Biene pointed to the additional costs associated with transport, logistics, and port inefficiencies as further deterrents to new investment. These infrastructural issues make it difficult for local manufacturers to remain competitive in the global market, which makes it even harder to approve additional investments into South Africa. Biene stressed that local manufacturers will struggle to thrive without strategic government interventions. “I don’t want protection because I’m not a protectionist advocate … but we need to incentivise local business, local manufacturing, and local trading,” she said. “Sometimes, as local manufacturers, we don’t feel as valued as we should be, and that is true also for legacy importers with a long-standing history in South Africa.” Biene said the government should recognise the automotive sector’s importance and implement policies supporting its growth. South Africa risks losing its local manufacturing base without such measures, which would have severe economic consequences. “We’ve invested in skills development, job creation, and infrastructure in South Africa,” she said. “Yet, we find ourselves unable to compete fairly due to structural inefficiencies and a lack of support.” Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Property · 9h New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Finance · 10h Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 12h New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 13h World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 15h Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16h End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Property · 18h Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses 5 Things · 18h One of South Africa’s richest families receives over R1 billion in Capitec shares, and blow for DStv owner Business · 19h Storm brewing over Mr Price deal to buy European retailer for R9.7 billion Government · 15 Jan 2026 United States releases alarming statement about South Africa Business · 15 Jan 2026 Township shopping mall to be sold for R177 million in South Africa Lifestyle · 15 Jan 2026 South Africans can now visit 101 countries visa-free in 2026 – losing access to 5 destinations Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

The Rea Vaya public transport system began as an ambitious plan to revolutionise urban mobility and align Johannesburg with its image as a World-Class City. However, the project has still not achieved its founding goal of linking Soweto and Sandton via cheap and efficient mass transport. The Rea Vaya project was initiated in 2006 after the City of Johannesburg studied and was inspired by Bogotá’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. The Bogotá’s Bus Rapid Transit system does not directly generate excessive monetary returns, but its economic impact is significant. It seeks to alleviate traffic congestion and encourages people to use public transportation, improving overall mobility in the city. This is important for a car-dependent city like Johannesburg. Rea Vaya, which means “we are going”, aims to provide accessible, reliable, and affordable public transportation for Johannesburg residents while reducing carbon emissions. The awarding of the 2010 FIFA World Cup to South Africa further accelerated the project as all eyes were on the country. Rea Vaya’s initial phase, connecting Soweto to the city center and Soccer City, was launched in August 2009, three years after the project’s inception in 2006. This relatively rapid implementation, partly driven by the 2010 FIFA World Cup, involved navigating bureaucratic processes and engaging with the taxi industry. Phase 1A comprised 25.5km of dedicated lanes, 30 stations, and 143 buses, plus feeder routes. Phase 1B, completed in February 2014, extended the network from Noordgesig, Soweto, through various suburbs to the CBD. Currently, 48 stations and 10 median key stations operate along 59 kilometres of trunk routes. A case study published by Metropolis shows that around 45,000 commuters use these routes daily. By the end of 2017, Phase 1A and 1B combined cost the ratepayer over R10 billion . While both phases are operational, they represent just a portion of the planned network. This is because in the years since, Rea Vaya’s progress has been hindered by a divided city council with 10 mayors since 2016, stalled negotiations with the taxi industry, and other issues. The unfinished phase One of the many stations that have sat idle on the Phase 1C route for nearly a decade. Photo: Seth Thorne Many commuters in Johannesburg would have come across the incomplete but expensive Phase 1C. Phase 1C was said to operate from the inner city through Hillbrow, Yeoville, Orange Grove, Bramley, and Wynberg to Alexandra and Sandton. According to the Rea Vaya website, “construction commenced in March 2014 and will be completed by 2017.” Eight years later, and over R1.5 billion has been spent on this phase, this has not happened yet. “We were told many years ago that we’d have these buses. I am still using a taxi to get to work. All they have done over the past couple of years is repaint the bus lanes that aren’t being used.,” said Rose, a resident of Yeoville who works in Rivonia. The status of Phase 1C stations is mixed. While some on the route have been completed, not all work has been finalised, and all remain idle. Some stations feature sandbags, while vandalism, gunshots, and broken glass have affected others. “It’s looking so unsightly,” said Tyrell Meyers, DA councillor and former chairman of the transport oversight committee. “It’s been quite a few years. The state of how it’s looking at the moment, I’m very concerned.” He said that the committee and officials have said that the first phase of Phase 1C will come online in phases starting in June and July 2025. As of last year, the Sandton Rea Vaya station’s overall construction was 37% complete, and the Gandhi Square station was 42% complete. Meyers attributes the delays in the Phase 1C to several key factors: Negotiations with Taxi Associations : A primary reason for delays was the difficult negotiations with taxi associations. These associations, anticipating their incorporation into a bus operating company, placed “high demands” on the city. Thus far, hundreds of taxi bosses have been incorporated, in deals worth hundreds of millions of rands between them and the City. For example, the owners of 317 minibus taxis were paid R263 Million for agreeing to have their vehicles removed from the road. Each owner pocketed about R830,000 per taxi. However, many still have taken aim at the system. Recently, the City of Johannesburg announced the suspension of the Rea Vaya bus services amid safety concerns . This comes after two Rea Vaya feeder bus drivers were shot and killed in Soweto. Construction Issues Delays also stemmed from construction-related problems, including issues with interchanges, bridge construction, and the conversion of high stations to low stations. Political and External Factors The 10 administrations since 2016 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic further impacted the project. According to Meyers, the change in administration shifted focus to the JITI (Johannesburg inner city transport infrastructure), while the pandemic caused the Rea Vaya project to be sidelined. Bus Depot Encroachment Much of the Alexandra Bus Depot that was meant to be utilised for the Rea Vaya Phase 1C route has been invaded by an informal settlement, despite over R140 million spent on the project. In 2024, the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) announced that another R170 million has been set to complete the investment in phase 1C infrastructure to bring it to operational readiness. “The project was phased according to budget availability, beginning with the construction of a blueprint station on Katherine Street, which set the groundwork for the rest of the project,” JDA spokesperson Elias Nkabinde recently said. “Following this, we focused on the Watt Interchange, one of the City’s largest infrastructure developments by both scope and scale,” he said. “This interchange is essential to the Phase 1C trunk route, acting as a crucial artery to facilitate efficient Rea Vaya operations.” Nkabinde added that R32 million had been allocated for the two incomplete Rea Vaya routes. “The longer the timelines aren’t met, the more cost it is going to be to the ratepayers and to residents,” said Meyers. “It should be the priority of any administration… especially with the investment that has been put in, to be not only completed but made a success,” added Meyers. The Alexandra Bus Company (ABC) is slated to run Phase 1C. Pricy bus lanes take up much-needed space along congested routes. Company in turmoil In December 2023 , Rea Vaya Phase1A operator PioTrans entered business rescue after a creditor attempted to repossess its buses. Senior Business Rescue Practitioner Mahier Tayob criticised the company for not seeking rescue sooner and plans to dissolve the current board, take control of operations, and hold those responsible for mismanagement accountable. PioTrans’ 12-year contract to operate Johannesburg’s bus rapid transit system ended in January 2023 amid complaints about unreliable services. Tayob noted long-standing issues, including alleged fraud and maladministration, and emphasised the company’s failure to inform creditors about its financial troubles, leading to its business rescue status. ”It has been widely reported that there was maladministration, if not fraud, at PioTrans, and it is unfortunate because the company should have been the nominated choice a long time ago,” said Tayob at the time. “For many years, there was no model for good business practices. The systems did not work. If systems were in place, they were violated. It was a recipe for disaster,” he told the Daily Maverick. “The company’s previous board continued to treat the crisis as normal. They managed the affairs of the company in the hope that it will one day come right,” he added. In 2024 , Johannesburg Transport MMC Kenny Kunene attributed corruption to the issues plaguing the Rea Vaya bus service and PioTrans. The project has also seen some questionable use of taxpayer funds. For example, News24 reported that ratepayers have been paying more than R750,000 in rent for one portable toilet at an incomplete station. ‘No comment’ BusinessTech contacted: Rea Vaya; Johannesburg Transport department; Spokespeople for the City of Johannesburg; The MMC for Transport’s office; The Johannesburg Development Agency; and The Johannesburg Road Agency.

Sales numbers over the last ten years show a declining demand for luxury cars in favour of cheaper alternatives in South Africa. In 2014, luxury brands such as Audi, BMW, Mini, and Mercedes-Benz collectively sold around 74,015 vehicles in South Africa. As of the end of 2024, this number had dropped to 23,881. This translates to a 68% drop in sales—highlighting the stagging amount of South Africans who no longer see these vehicles as an option. The biggest loser was Mercedes-Benz, dropping 82% to 5,048 sold units in 2024 from 28,993. This was followed by Audi (-70%) and then BMW and Mini (-50%). In contrast, vehicles from Asia—such as Chery, Haval, and Suzuki—have seen massive growth over the same period. In 2014, these three car brands collectively sold 8,127. This has increased by a whopping 1,000% to 89,416 in 2024. This is primarily thanks to Sukuzi’s impressive growth, which increased sales from 6,402 in 2014 to 56,109 (776%) in 2024. While Suzuki almost hit 60,000 sales last year, Chery grew 1,435% from 1,297 to 19,911 in 2024, and Haval grew 3,029% from 428 to 13,396 in 2024. The National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) told BusinessTech that this trend is due to the price-sensitivity shift in the South African market over the years. “The South African vehicle market is increasingly price-sensitive, with affordability remaining a challenge due to high inflation, interest rates and fuel costs. “Most buyers are now shopping in the sub-R350,000 range, where Chinese brands offer strong perceived value at an accessible price point,” said NADA. “These vehicles provide high-quality specifications, advanced technology, and competitive pricing, making them an attractive alternative to traditional luxury brands. “Dealers welcome these options as they cater to a broader customer base. “However, over the medium to long term, factors such as running costs, reliability, parts availability, crash panel replacement, and resale value will ultimately determine which brands succeed and which fade from the market,” the association added. Wealthy buyers feeling the pinch Benay Sager, executive head of DebtBusters, highlighted during the release of DebtBusters’ Q4 2024 Debt Index that South Africans taking home more than R35,000 per month are under severe pressure. He said that while the economic environment improved in some respects, the underlying financial strain on households persists. Sager noted that one of the most concerning trends is the rising debt-to-annual income ratio, which climbed for the second consecutive quarter in Q4 2024 and is now standing at 113%. He added that the financial strain is particularly concerning among South Africa’s middle to high-income earners. “Consumers earning R20,000 per month face a debt-to-income ratio of 137%, while those taking home R35,000 or more grapple with a staggering 187% ratio—the highest levels ever recorded,” he said. Sager also pointed out that this situation of unsustainable debt levels is exacerbated by stagnant salary growth. “Compared to 2016, South Africans have seen a 42% reduction in purchasing power. While nominal incomes are 2% higher than eight years ago, cumulative inflation of 44% has eroded real earnings,” he said. “Even for those earning R35,000 or more per month, where nominal incomes have grown by 10%, the gains are negligible when adjusted for inflation,” said Sager. This environment has materially impacted the sales of premium vehicles, as South Africans prioritise affordability and value for money. “Affordability is still a major concern for buyers, and this pressure is evident nationwide,” said NADA. “We’re witnessing competitive Chinese brands gaining traction, offering consumers affordable alternatives that are reshaping the market,” it added. A recent analysis by BusinessTech on the price changes of German luxury cars over the last four years underscores the pressure of affordability. The Audi A1 now costs R523,200, 18.6% more than its price of R441,000 in 2021. BMW’s 1 Series is now R713,395, a 29% increase from R553,220 in 2021. The Mercedes-Benz A-Class has seen the most significant price increase. It now costs R826,024, 41% more than the R585,960 price tag it had three years ago. These increases are much higher than inflation, especially for BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which went far beyond the 20% inflation rate over the same period. The long-term trend of price increases made by these manufacturers also paints a stark picture of escalating costs. For example, a Mercedes-Benz GLA200 that cost R400,000 in 2014 now costs R926,703, marking a staggering 131.4% increase in just 10 years.

After a strong lineup in 2024, including the next-gen Toyota Prado, Ford Mustang, BMW X3, Suzuki Swift, and Chery Tiggo Cross, the coming year promises even more variety and innovation. One of the biggest highlights in 2025 will be the highly anticipated Kia Tasman, marking the Korean brand’s debut in the bakkie segment. Additionally, the Ford Ranger Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) is set to launch, though its availability in South Africa remains uncertain despite local production in Pretoria. SUVs continue to dominate the local market, and 2025 will see several noteworthy additions. Renault will introduce a new iteration of the Duster, one of the most affordable 4×4 crossovers available. Audi is bringing the next-generation Q5, completing the trio of German midsize SUVs alongside the recently updated BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC. Meanwhile, Volkswagen is replacing the Tiguan Allspace with the new Tayron, positioned between the Tiguan and the larger Touareg. The Tayron is expected to come with a choice of a 110 kW 1.4-litre turbo petrol engine or a more powerful 140 kW 2.0-litre turbo petrol, both paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Toyota has remained secretive about its future releases, but the company confirmed in 2024 that the bZ4X Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) will be arriving in South Africa. Kia will expand its offerings with the new Sorento and Carnival, while Renault plans to roll out updates for the Captur, Kiger, and the all-new Arkana. Chinese automakers are making significant strides in the South African market, with Jetour launching the Dashing, X70 Plus, and the new T2. Chery will introduce the plug-in hybrid (PHEV) versions of the Tiggo 7 Pro and Tiggo 8 Pro alongside its flagship Tiggo 9 Pro. Additionally, Omoda and Jaecoo have ambitious plans to bring at least six new models, including the C7, C9 PHEV, J5, J6, J7 PHEV, and J8. For hatchback enthusiasts, 2025 brings some exciting developments. Volkswagen is planning a non-performance Golf model, offering a more accessible TSI variant to complement the GTI and R versions. Renault will launch an updated Clio, while Audi will roll out the latest A3 and high-performance RS3. New Renault Clio Meanwhile, Mini has an action-packed year ahead with the release of the new Aceman, Cooper Convertible, and John Cooper Works models. Fiat and Abarth are also set to make an impact with the 500e, the first fully-electric models from Stellantis in South Africa. While their launch was initially slated for 2024, delays have pushed it into 2025. These compact EVs will offer options for both mainstream buyers and performance enthusiasts. With such an array of new models arriving, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the South African car industry. Consumers will have more options, and economic factors will also improve buyer confidence. According to AutoTrader, South Africa is seeing an increase in consumer confidence, with lower interest rates and stabilising fuel prices encouraging vehicle purchases. November 2024 saw a 0.25% cut in interest rates, making car financing more accessible. Furthermore, while fuel prices remain high at R22.41 per litre as of February 2025, the downward trend from previous years is a welcome relief. “Falling interest rates and petrol prices are giving South African motorists and consumers plenty to smile about,” said Angelique Lynch, AutoTrader’s Marketing Director. With these economic improvements and an influx of exciting new models across various segments, the automotive landscape in South Africa is set for an exciting year ahead. Please note that this new car list is generated based on what has been reported publicly by reputable motoring publications. We have tried our utmost to make this list as accurate and as definitive as possible. It’s also worth mentioning that arrival timings for new cars are tentative and are subject to change due to ongoing changes in the global supply chain. Here’s some notable models coming this year.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/811101/bad-news-about-driving-licences-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:18:34+00:00,,Bad news about driving licences in South Africa,,"Motoring Staff Writer 11 Feb 2025 Motoring Bad news about driving licences in South Africa Staff Writer · 11 Feb 2025 The Auditor-General (AG) has concluded an investigation into a controversial driver’s licence card printing machine tender that could significantly delay South Africa’s new licence cards. South Africa is moving to new smart driving licence cards with enhanced security features to combat fraud and counterfeiting. Another benefit is that the new driving licence cards would be produced at a faster rate, cutting down on motorists’ waiting times to renew their licences. The Driving Licence Card Account (DLCA), a Department of Transport entity, had to procure a new machine to produce the new cards. South Africa’s current driver’s licence card printing machine is 26 years old and has experienced 159 breakdowns. There is no backup printing machine, which means a breakdown can significantly delay motorists’ getting their new licence cards. On 1 September 2024, the Department of Transport announced that it had appointed IDEMIA Identity and Security to produce new smart driving licence cards. However, this tender was marred with controversy, including the contract price ballooning from the budgeted R468 million to R899 million. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) also alleged tampering with the pricing envelopes in the bids and that at least one bidder was wrongly marked down. On 5 September 2024, Transport Minister Barbara Creecy requested the Auditor-General to expedite and widen the scope of this tender. It included whether supply chain management prescripts were followed, personal data safety specifications, and IDEMEIA’s technical capacity. In January 2025, the Auditor-General handed the investigation report to the Minister of Transport, Barbara Creecy. Department of Transport spokesperson Collen Msibi said the report was being studied, and a public statement on its findings would be issued at an appropriate time. Creecy committed to releasing an executive summary of the Auditor-General report, including recommendations on the way forward. New driving licence card delay The latest debacle surrounding the new driving licence card printing machine tender will further delay South Africa’s progress towards smart licences. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s cabinet approved the new driving licence cards and printer plan in August 2022 and issued the relevant tender. The aim was a three-year phased rollout of the new system from 2023 to 2026. However, this did not happen. The missed deadlines were blamed on issues surrounding the printing machine tender, which was withdrawn, and a new one issued in 2023. Former Transport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga said printing the new driving licence cards would begin in April 2024. Again, this did not happen. In July 2024, there was encouraging news that IDEMIA Identity was selected and would procure three driving licence card printing machines. Two machines will be used at the primary driving licence card production site, while one will be reserved for the disaster recovery site. This meant that South Africa would no longer be reliant on a single printing machine, which was prone to breakdowns and long delays. Creecy added that the new machines will be maintained and repaired in South Africa, unlike the current machine, which must be shipped overseas for repairs. However, should the Auditor-General report point to wrongdoing, it is a distinct possibility and can cause further delays. Outa CEO Wayne Duvenage has already called on Creecy to cancel the current tender and reopen a new one with robust oversight mechanisms. He added that if the minister decides to award the tender to Idemia and not halt the process, it will likely lead to litigation. Therefore, South Africans should not expect to see the new driving licence cards and quicker turnaround times anytime soon. This is a blow to South African motorists who dread renewing their driving licence cards every five years due to the unpleasant experience associated with it.

In South Africa, a car is seen as an important status symbol, and many people cannot wait to buy their first luxury car. Showing off your new BMW or Mercedes-Benz portraits that you are financially secure and have achieved career success. However, buying an expensive luxury vehicle comes at a tremendous cost. It is a poor investment which destroys wealth. Daily Investor compared the difference between buying a luxury vehicle and opting for a cheaper alternative and investing the savings in the S&P 500. For this comparison, we selected two of the most popular vehicles in their respective categories and considered their financial impact over six years. BMW X3 xDrive 20d Toyota Corolla Quest Plus We assumed that the two buyers had the same budget. The first one spent his full budget on a car, and the second selected a cheaper car and invested the rest of the money. Both vehicles were purchased in 2019 with loans covering 100% of the purchase price at an interest rate of 13%, repayable over a 6-year term. Both cars were insured using a constant insurance profile to make the insurance premiums comparable. It should be noted that insurance is subjectively applied to individuals and will differ from person to person. In this case, the insurance profile was kept the same for both vehicles, which means the insurance premiums can be compared. Insurance quotes were obtained from Naked Insurance for brand-new models of the same vehicle and proportionally applied to their 2019 prices. We assumed the insurer’s risk profile remained constant over the 6 years, and the premium was adjusted for inflation to cover the vehicle’s replacement value. For the sake of simplicity, it was assumed that both vehicles were sold with a complete service plan covering all maintenance expenses over their 6-year financing period. Only the fixed costs of the vehicles were compared. This means that costs such as fuel and tyre wear were not included. In 2019, a new BMW X3 xDrive 20d cost R789,000 and could be comprehensively insured for R2,001 per month. To own this car, the monthly repayment would be R15,668, paid from January 2019 to December 2024. This would bring the total fixed costs of the BMW to R17,669 per month, which gradually increased to R18,161 over the repayment period due to rising insurance. In 2019, a new Toyota Corolla Quest Plus cost R277,000 and could be comprehensively insured for R1,109 monthly. The monthly repayment on the vehicle for six years was R5,501 over the same period as the BMW. This brought the total fixed costs of the Toyota Corolla to R6,610 per month, which gradually increased to R6,883 per month due to rising insurance costs. This means that the owner of the Corolla saved R11,059 per month from the first month by not buying a BMW. Every month, the Toyota Corolla owner invested his savings in the S&P 500, which helped him accumulate wealth while driving a cheaper car. After six years, when both cars were paid off, the BMW X3 xDrive 20d owner can sell his car for R468,900. The car was his entire investment over the period. The owner of the Toyota Corolla can sell his car for R209,900. However, his S&P 500 investment with the excess cash grew to R1,423,942. This means the Toyota Corolla Quest Plus had assets of R1,633,842 after six years, much more than the BMW owner’s R468,900. It shows that buying a more affordable car and investing the rest created wealth of R1.164 million over six years. The table below summarises the difference between buying a luxury and a more affordable car over six years. Measure BMW X3 xDrive 20d Corolla Quest Plus Car Value after 6 years R468,900 R209,900 S&P500 Zero R1,423,942 Total Wealth R468,900 R1,633,842 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

According to the Fidelity Services Group, there was a notable decrease in hijackings by 27.3% between November and December 2024. Wahl Bartmann, CEO of Fidelity Group, told BusinessTech that this decline is due to a seasonal dip in organised crime activity as syndicate members often take holidays during the festive season. CEO of Fidelity Group Wahl Bartmann Despite this reprieve, hijackings are expected to rise again from late January, with a big jump in February and March 2025. The number of incidents should level off by mid-year but could spike again in August and November. Regarding the most popular cars among hijackers, security experts, including Bartmann, note that vehicle hijackings are largely a business driven by demand and supply in South Africa. Popular models are targeted due to the high demand for their parts or resale value, often through illicit markets. For years, cars from Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford have been the most targeted vehicles, and this still holds true. However, the rise of Chinese automakers in the South African market has introduced new targets. This was first flagged by Fidelity ADT in the middle of last year. Brands like Chery and GWM, whose sales have skyrocketed by 1,749% over the last decade, are now being flagged by security groups as increasingly vulnerable. This means more of these cars are on the road, creating a bigger market for their parts. While Fidelity did not specify particular models, industry trends and sales data from Naamsa provide insights. The Haval Jolion and Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, which ranked among the top-selling cars at the end of 2024, are likely targets. Larger SUVs like the Haval H6 and Chery Tiggo 7 Pro also remain popular among the brands and are thus at risk. These vehicles join perennial favourites on hijackers’ lists, which are: VW Polo Toyota Hilux Ford Ranger Toyota Corolla Cross Toyota Fortuner Haval Jolion Chery Tiggo 4 Pro Haval H6 Chery Tiggo 7 Pro Haval Jolion Pro One recent incident underscores the vulnerability of these vehicles, including the new entries. Less than 10 days ago, a hijacked Toyota Corolla Cross was recovered in KwaMashu. The suspects tried to escape when they saw security officers but lost control of the car. One suspect was arrested, but two others got away. This shows that even newer car models can quickly become targets for criminals. This incident highlights the importance of vigilance, even for owners of vehicles that are relatively new to hijackers’ radar. Bartmann said popular models are often targeted because they blend in easily on South African roads, especially in colours like white and silver. Hijackers typically strip these cars for parts or re-register them through corrupt channels for resale. The Toyota Corolla Cross, for instance, became the fourth most popular new car sold in 2024 despite only being launched in 2021, which coincides with its emergence as a hijacking target. As the popularity of Chinese cars like Chery and GWM grows, so does their appeal to criminals. While the listed vehicles are expected to dominate the hijacking landscape in 2025, it is crucial to remember that no car is entirely immune. Bartmann emphasises that hijackings can occur at any time and in any location. “Staying alert is probably the most important tip,” he advises. “Too often, we are distracted, which makes us vulnerable to criminal activity. “The best response is to be alert and aware of any suspicious activity near you.” Owners of high-target vehicles should take extra precautions, such as installing advanced tracking devices or avoiding high-risk areas during certain times. Ultimately, the high popularity of certain vehicles translates to their increased likelihood of being hijacked. Comparing the number of vehicles on the road with the corresponding hijacking incidents could offer a clearer picture of criminal preferences. However, as Bartmann underscores, vigilance is essential for everyone, regardless of the make or model of their car.

Buying a new car in South Africa has become increasingly challenging as vehicle prices continue to rise. According to TransUnion’s latest reports, the cost of hatchbacks, often the most affordable option from luxury brands, has surged by 7.6%. Despite these price hikes, there are still a dozen new cars available for under R250,000 in 2025, making them accessible to many South Africans. A combination of economic pressures, inflation, and rising production costs has contributed to the overall increase in vehicle prices. Global supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations, and higher interest rates have all played a role in making new cars more expensive. However, for budget-conscious buyers, some options are still available that provide reliable and economical transportation. The list of new cars available for under R250,000 includes five Suzuki models, two Renault models, and one model each from Toyota, Proton, Hyundai, Citroën, and Nissan. Suzuki, known for its affordability and fuel efficiency, dominates the budget-friendly segment, while other manufacturers continue to offer competitive options within this price range. When considering a car purchase, financial experts advise that vehicle-related expenses should not exceed 25% of one’s monthly net income. With Stats SA reporting the average salary in South Africa at R28,220 per month, this means that many individuals can allocate up to R7,055 for car payments and related costs. This budget places these 12 affordable cars within reach for a significant portion of the population. Financing is a popular option for buyers who cannot afford to pay the full purchase price upfront. WesBank’s vehicle finance calculator gives an idea of what buyers can expect to pay each month. Based on a five-year financing term with no deposit and a 0% balloon payment at an interest rate of 11%, monthly repayments for the automatic models in this price range range from R3,383 to R4,689. These figures make these vehicles not only practical but also financially feasible for many South Africans. While affordability remains a key concern, buyers should also consider factors such as fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and insurance premiums when selecting a vehicle. With rising living expenses, choosing a car that offers good fuel economy and low running costs is crucial for long-term financial sustainability. Despite economic challenges and rising costs, South Africans still have options when it comes to buying a new car on a budget. The availability of these 12 models under R250,000 ensures that reliable and affordable vehicles remain accessible, allowing buyers to navigate the financial landscape without overstretching their budgets. These cars are listed below.

Creecy expressed disappointment at the rise in fatalities and crashes during the period, attributing much of the blame to human behaviour. An alarming example of this recklessness came from Gauteng, where a driver was clocked at a staggering 245km/h on the N1 near Honeydew on 18 December 2024 while driving a BMW sedan. This was the highest speed recorded by traffic authorities over the festive season. The numbers paint a grim picture. A total of 1,502 lives were lost in 1,234 crashes, marking a 5.3% increase in fatalities and a 4.2% rise in crashes compared to the previous festive season. Creecy called this a disappointing regression after years of steady progress in reducing road deaths. Six provinces—KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo, Northern Cape, and North West—reported an increase in fatalities, further emphasizing the scale of the problem. Human behaviour was identified as the primary cause of 87% of crashes. Factors included hit-and-runs, jaywalking, driving while fatigued, speeding, drunk driving, and dangerous overtaking. Creecy stressed the urgent need for a shift in mindset among both drivers and pedestrians. “The number of people dying has gone up because of bad behaviour. We’ve warned people, but too many drivers and pedestrians still act irresponsibly,” she said. The high number of speed-related arrests during the festive period shockingly illustrates this irresponsibility. Traffic authorities arrested 414 drivers for speeding, with five of them driving at speeds ranging from 200km/h to well above 240km/h. Creecy’s call for stricter enforcement reflects the gravity of such violations. Penalty for speeding Speeding offences in South Africa are subject to a graded system of fines. The country allows a 10km/h tolerance over the speed limit to account for minor calibration discrepancies in vehicle speedometers. To exceed the limit by 10-15km/h, the minimum fine is R250, with an additional R250 for every 5km/h increment. Once a driver exceeds the limit by 36-40km/h, the maximum fine of R1,500 is imposed. Speeds beyond this threshold result in arrest, and the driver must appear before a public prosecutor. Drivers caught exceeding the speed limit by 10-40km/h may face an “Admission of Guilt” fine, allowing them to pay a monetary penalty without a court appearance. However, those caught driving more than 40km/h over the limit are issued a “Non-Admission of Guilt” notice. In these cases, the fine amount is determined by a public prosecutor during a court trial. Depending on the severity of the offence and the prosecutor’s discretion, offenders may also face a prison sentence. Creecy underscored the importance of holding reckless drivers accountable. “On behalf of the national Department of Transport, provincial MECs and their departments, and all law enforcement agencies, I call on the courts to treat these cases with the seriousness they deserve,” she said. “There must be consequences for drivers who break the law with wanton disregard for the lives of other road users, whether it is for speeding, drunk driving, or any other offence which warrants arrest and prosecution.” The festive season’s statistics serve as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by reckless driving and the urgent need for stricter road safety measures to prevent further loss of life.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/808579/8-ways-to-save-petrol-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:18:55+00:00,,8 ways to save petrol in South Africa,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 26 Jan 2025 Motoring 8 ways to save petrol in South Africa Malcolm Libera · 26 Jan 2025 The first months of the year have already delivered steep increases in both petrol and diesel prices, and February promises little relief. Despite a slightly stronger rand and lower oil prices, data from the Central Energy Fund highlights under-recoveries of up to 93 cents per litre for petrol and R1.10 per litre for diesel. With these challenges in mind, Cartrack has outlined eight practical strategies to help vehicle owners mitigate fuel costs. Fuel savings start with adopting efficient driving habits. Driving at moderate speeds, typically between 65 and 90 km/h, reduces drag on the vehicle and eases the engine’s workload, resulting in lower fuel consumption. Additionally, avoiding congested routes, maintaining a consistent engine speed of around 3000 rpm, and steering clear of frequent lane changes and abrupt stops in heavy traffic can significantly improve fuel efficiency. Another often-overlooked technique is engine braking , which involves lifting your foot off the accelerator to let the engine slow the vehicle down. This method is particularly useful when approaching traffic lights or stop signs, as it reduces reliance on the brake pedal and conserves fuel. Pairing this approach with driving in higher gears can further enhance fuel efficiency, as lower engine revolutions per minute (RPM) demand less fuel. For those considering a new vehicle purchase, opting for a fuel-efficient model is a long-term solution. Cars with smaller engines or hybrid technology are designed to deliver excellent performance while consuming less fuel. Key factors to consider when selecting a fuel-efficient vehicle include engine size, weight, and fuel consumption rates. Smaller, lighter vehicles typically burn less fuel, offering sustained savings over time. Maintaining optimal tyre pressure is another critical aspect of fuel efficiency. Tyres that are underinflated increase rolling resistance, forcing the engine to work harder and burn more fuel. On the other hand, overinflated tyres can negatively affect handling, cause uneven tread wear, and reduce road contact, which is particularly dangerous at high speeds. Checking tyre pressure at least once a month and adhering to the manufacturer’s recommendations can help minimise fuel consumption and extend tyre life. When travelling at high speeds, it’s best to keep windows closed . While the refreshing breeze of an open window might be tempting, it increases air resistance, especially at speeds above 80 km/h. Using the vehicle’s ventilation system instead of open windows can improve aerodynamics and enhance fuel efficiency. Another way to save on fuel is to avoid heavy loads . Excess weight, whether from luggage or equipment, makes the engine work harder, leading to higher fuel consumption. Roof racks, in particular, increase air resistance and diminish a vehicle’s aerodynamics. Packing light and removing unnecessary items, especially for long-distance trips, can contribute to smoother and more fuel-efficient journeys. For those with vehicles equipped with cruise control , this feature can be a valuable tool for saving fuel on highways. Cruise control maintains a steady speed, eliminating the need for constant acceleration and deceleration, which are major contributors to fuel consumption. This results in a smoother and more fuel-efficient driving experience. Another effective strategy is to take advantage of loyalty programs offered by petrol stations, banks, and retailers. These programs reward drivers with points or discounts each time they refuel. Over time, accumulated points can be redeemed for fuel or other benefits, providing tangible savings. Selecting a loyalty program that aligns with your needs and preferred petrol station locations can make a noticeable difference. As fuel prices continue to climb, adopting these ten strategies can help South African motorists mitigate the impact on their wallets. From efficient driving techniques to regular vehicle maintenance and thoughtful planning, these practical steps can make a significant difference.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/808599/good-news-for-gwm-and-haval-drivers-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:18:59+00:00,,Good news for GWM and Haval drivers in South Africa,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 25 Jan 2025 Motoring Good news for GWM and Haval drivers in South Africa Malcolm Libera · 25 Jan 2025 Drivers of GWM and Haval vehicles in South Africa have something to celebrate: the introduction of a new 7-year/200,000km warranty for almost all models in the range. This significant enhancement places these vehicles among those with the longest warranties in the country, a move that underscores GWM’s commitment to delivering value and peace of mind to its customers. This upgraded warranty is a major leap from the brand’s previous standard of 5 years/100,000km. Not only has the mileage coverage doubled, but it also comes at no extra cost to buyers. While not every model is impacted—notably the Steed, a workhorse bakkie aimed at commercial users—the change applies to the brand’s most popular vehicles. The GWM P-Series, Haval H6, and Haval Jolion City are the main beneficiaries, with the Jolion Pro already enjoying this extended warranty. For customers of these best-selling models, this translates to greater long-term security and increased resale value, as the warranty is transferable to subsequent owners. Interestingly, this change aligns with GWM’s broader strategy of staying competitive in a rapidly growing market for Chinese vehicles in South Africa. Brands like Chery, Omoda, Jaecoo, Jetour, and GAC have aggressively marketed themselves with robust warranty offerings. For example, Chery and its offshoots provide a 10-year/1-million-kilometre engine warranty, while GAC offers a lifetime engine warranty. However, these warranties are limited to the first owner, leaving second-hand buyers with reduced coverage. GWM’s approach to making its warranty transferable adds an extra layer of appeal for used car buyers. In addition to the 7-year/200,000km warranty, GWM and Haval have also introduced an 8-year/150,000km powertrain warranty for their hybrid and electric models. These vehicles further benefit from a 7-year/75,000km service plan, enhancing their overall value proposition. Previously, models like the Haval H6 launched with a more modest 5-year/60,000km plan, so this marks a notable improvement. Haval Jolion GWM’s efforts to elevate its warranty and service offerings come at a time when Chinese carmakers are experiencing a surge in popularity in South Africa. The affordability, modern designs, and feature-packed vehicles from brands like GWM and Haval have resonated strongly with local consumers. This demand is evident in the growing market share of Chinese cars, as buyers increasingly recognise the value and reliability they provide. Enhancing the warranty for these models ensures that a substantial number of South African drivers will benefit directly. Moreover, the growing trust in GWM and Haval is reflective of the broader shift in consumer attitudes toward Chinese vehicles.

These cars, which used to be somewhat affordable for higher middle-income families, are now so expensive that only the wealthiest buyers can afford them. At current prices, South Africans need to be in the top 10% of income earners to afford these vehicles. This means that 90% of the population earns less than this threshold, highlighting how exclusive it has become to own even the cheapest models from these premium brands. Over the last year, car prices in many categories have increased significantly. Hatchbacks, which are often the cheapest cars from luxury brands, have had some of the biggest jumps, with prices rising by 7.6%. Hybrids also increased by 4.6%, while SUVs and electric cars had smaller increases of 2.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The Audi A1, BMW 1 Series, and Mercedes-Benz A-Class show how much prices have climbed. The Audi A1 now costs R523,200, which is 18.6% more than its price of R441,000 in 2021. BMW’s 1 Series is now R713,395, a 29% increase from R553,220 in 2021. The Mercedes-Benz A-Class has seen the biggest jump. It now costs R826,024, which is 41% more than the R585,960 price tag it had three years ago. These increases are much higher than inflation, especially for BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which went far beyond the 20% inflation rate over the same period. The long-term trends also paint a stark picture of escalating costs. For instance, a Mercedes-Benz GLA200 that cost R400,000 in 2014 now costs R926,703, marking a staggering 131.4% increase in just 10 years. There are several reasons for these price hikes. One big reason is the weak South African rand, which makes importing cars and car parts more expensive. The country’s slow economy has also played a role. On top of that, carmakers are adding new technology, like better safety features and high-tech systems, which raises manufacturing costs. Additionally, South Africa has raised import duties and taxes on vehicles, making imported cars more expensive. This policy aims to protect local industries but results in higher prices for consumers. Manufacturers have also incorporated more advanced safety features and technology into new models, which raises production costs and, consequently, retail prices.

Associations representing both automotive component makers and car manufacturers — including Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp. — said in near-identical letters seen by Bloomberg that they need at least a year to source alternative steel supplies. They warned that plants may close and that components made locally would need to be imported, threatening thousands of jobs in an industry that employs more than 116,000 people. ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd., or AMSA, on 6 January said it would close mills that produce so-called long-steel products in the towns of Newcastle and Vereeniging and a rail-fabrication facility in eMalahleni because it couldn’t make them profitable. The operations are the only local suppliers of several products used in industries ranging from construction to mining and carmaking. The associations “on behalf of their members, therefore, urgently make an appeal to the Department of Trade Industry and Competition to support AMSA in finding at least a transitional solution,” they said in the letter to Trade Minister Parks Tau. This is needed “to avoid auto-sector disruptions and the severe threat of de-localisation and, ultimately, de-industrialisation,” they said. AMSA said Chief Executive Officer Kobus Verster was copied on the letter sent to the trade minister but wasn’t aware of a letter sent directly to the company. Tau said government and company officials engage “on a daily basis” and met in person Wednesday. “We are cautiously optimistic,” he said Thursday. “We are engaging to avert a situation where there would be a closure — discussions are at a sensitive stage right now.” The Automotive Business Council — also known as Naamsa — didn’t respond to a request for comment on the letter. “The absence of this reliable local steel supply could lead to line stoppages, plant closures and volume cuts, jeopardizing both the sustainability of component suppliers and original equipment manufacturers,” National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers Chief Executive Officer Renai Moothilal said in a statement sent to Bloomberg. He confirmed the authenticity of the letters. Steel imports could be 25% more expensive, he said. Moothilal said the impact on local supply chains could see 3,000 jobs lost immediately and 13,000 jobs lost over time. The auto industry employed more than 116,500 people directly last year. AMSA, which produces steel from iron ore, had initially announced plans to close the operations about a year ago before putting that decision on hold in July. The company said the businesses are unviable because of poor rail service, high electricity costs, a flood of low-cost imports and government policy that keeps the price of steel scrap — used as a raw material by AMSA’s smaller rivals — artificially low. In the letters to AMSA and the minister, the associations said that their industries used 70,000 tons of “speciality long-steel grades” annually that can only be supplied locally by the company. They said they hadn’t been given time to find alternative sources through imports, and a change in steel suppliers would result in a round of length, stringent testing, and approvals. That would likely see them using already-approved parts from suppliers outside South Africa, damaging the local car-spares industry, they said. “Localized parts will be delocalized for a significant duration,” they said in the letters. The automotive industry accounts for about 5.3% of South Africa’s gross domestic product, and cars and auto components account for 15% of exports. Stellantis NV, Ford Motor Co., Mercedes-Benz Group AG, BMW AG and Isuzu Motors Ltd. also make cars in South Africa.

BusinessTech investigated the costs in Gauteng, the Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal, highlighting some notable changes and discrepancies. In Gauteng, licensing fees increased by 6% to 7% as of April 2024. For example, a car weighing between 750kg and 1,000kg now costs R432 annually to licence. While Gauteng saw a rise, the Western Cape also implemented a fee hike of 4% to 5%, but it still remains the cheapest out of the three provinces for renewals. In the Western Cape, the annual cost for a small hatchback is R390, while a large SUV like a Toyota Land Cruiser costs R1,458. Comparatively, KwaZulu-Natal has maintained its 2024 rates. Still, it remains the most expensive of the three provinces, with fees for similar vehicles exceeding those in Gauteng and the Western Cape by up to R84 and R306, respectively. Motorists across South Africa are subject to a 21-day grace period for renewing expired licences. Beyond this, penalties accrue at 10% of the annual fee for each month overdue. This rule highlights the financial burden of delaying renewals, making timely payments essential. This means, for example, a late renewal penalty of R43.20 per month if the licence lapses beyond the 21-day grace period for a hatchback in Gauteng. The conversation around digital driver and vehicle licences has also gained traction. Experts like Rob Handfield-Jones argue that South Africa has the technology to digitise the licensing process, which could simplify renewals and reduce costs. He points to the efficiency of platforms like SARS eFiling, suggesting similar systems could be applied to vehicle licencing. This would eliminate the need for physical licence discs and paperwork, potentially saving time and money for both motorists and the government. However, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) believes the slow move toward digitalisation is intentional. Outa asserts that the government’s reliance on revenue from licencing fees is a significant barrier to adopting a streamlined, cost-effective system. They argue that digital licences, while beneficial to motorists, might reduce income from fees and penalties. For now, motorists must navigate a system marked by regional disparities and a reliance on traditional processes, with hopes for a more efficient future on the horizon. The table below shows the car licence renewal fees for passenger vehicles in the three provinces, depending on the relevant weight of the car, as outlined by Foresight Publications .

The car brand has come and gone in South Africa over the decades, reentering the country in 2011 but leaving again in 2016. The 100-year-old company was founded as Morris Garages by William Morris in the UK, with the brand becoming well-known for its sports car offerings. The company was then taken over by SAIC Motor (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation) in 2007. MG vehicles are now designed and developed by SAIC, and manufacturing mainly occurs in China. MG has been China’s largest single-brand car exporter since 2019 and produced 840,000 vehicles globally in 2023. 88% of the group’s sales occurred outside of China, and it has been named the fastest-growing automotive brand in the UK for the past two years. “We are confident MG will perform just as well in the local market,” said Sky Zhang, general manager for MG Motor South Africa. “This is why we are launching initially with 25 dealers with plans for more over the next two years.” “We understand that driving preferences vary significantly across regions, and we’ve placed a strong emphasis on tailoring our offerings.” This is aimed at meeting the specific tastes of local consumers and engineering these likes and dislikes into its design and engineering processes. “This makes MG so much more than just an affordable car; it stands out as a brand designed for mainstream markets with a unique identity.” Zhang added that the brand is dedicated to ensuring local stability, which includes comprehensive service and support networks, leading to local job creation and partnerships. The company is also committed to establishing a sound parts supply chain in South Africa, with its National Parts Distribution Centre already in place in Isando, Kempton Park. A locally available inventory of parts has also been sourced to minimise downtime and deliver efficient servicing. MG is also offering a comprehensive service plan and a “class-leading” warranty. The cars With its launch, MG is offering three cars. The MG ZS is the cheapest model in the new MG lineup, with the crossover having a starting price of under R300,000. The MG HS is a midsize SUV with prices starting from R500,000 and rising to over R650,000. The final part of the lineup is the MG Cyberster, an electric sports car, starting from R1.4 million. According to MG’s LinkedIn , the new cars will launch in South Africa tomorrow, 21 January 2025.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/807263/serious-accusations-against-south-africas-largest-airline/,2026-01-18T00:19:16+00:00,,Serious accusations against South Africa’s largest airline,,"Motoring Staff Writer 19 Jan 2025 Motoring Serious accusations against South Africa’s largest airline Staff Writer · 19 Jan 2025 FlySafair is accused of flouting local and international airline rules, unlawfully overbooking seats, and using dirty tricks to avoid compensating customers. CemAir CEO Miles Van Der Molen told Biznews there is mounting evidence that FlySafair has broken the rules to gain an unfair advantage in the local aviation market. The first problem is ownership. South Africa’s Air Services Licensing Act stipulates that domestic airlines must have at least 75% local ownership. The International Air Services Act requires substantial local shareholding, which is widely accepted to be above 50%. FlySafair is 74.86% owned by ASL Aviation Group, which seems to be prima facie evidence that it has broken these rules. South Africa’s Air Services Licensing Council ruled that FlySafair does not comply with the Air Services Licensing Act. The International Air Services Council (IASC) also ruled that FlySafair’s shareholding structure was not compliant with the law. It said the company structure comprised a 49.86% shareholding by the Safair Investment Trust, which is 100% owned by ASL, in addition to the 25% direct ASL shareholding. The IASC also ruled that FlySafair failed to apply for an amendment of its air service licence when its ownership structure changed in March 2019. The two councils are expected to announce their sanctions soon, which may include suspending FlySafair’s license, imposing fines, or even filing criminal charges. Should FlySafair planes be grounded, it would wreak havoc on the local aviation sector and leave many local and international travellers stranded. Despite the significant impact of such a decision, Van Der Molen said an airline cannot break the rules without repercussions. “Convenience cannot come above the law. If FlySafair isn’t complying, that has to be dealt with,” he said. “Yes, it would be a shock to the market, but they have gained a dominant position by using tactics they shouldn’t have. The law should be upheld.” FlySafair overbooking investigation Cemair CEO Miles Van Der Molen (left) The second problem is overbooking. FlySafair clients complained about being stranded despite having paid for a seat. The airline admitted that it overbooked flights, arguing that it was to ensure it could keep its tickets as affordable as possible for passengers. However, overbooking is prohibited by the Consumer Protection Act, which prompted the National Consumer Commission (NCC) to launch an investigation. The NCC said it had established communication with the airline and requested relevant information to kick-start the investigation. FlySafair responded to the investigation by saying that overbooking is a standard and globally accepted practice employed by airlines. They argued it was needed to manage operations efficiently, mitigate the financial impact of no-show passengers, and keep air travel affordable. “This practice has been used by all local airlines, past and present, as well as international carriers selling tickets to South African consumers,” it added. “FlySafair applies this principle in a responsible and customer-centric manner, ensuring that we balance efficiency with fairness,” it said. Van Der Molen said this is a lie. Many airlines, including Cemair, have released statements saying they don’t overbook flights. “Our understanding is that it’s not allowed. For FlySafair to go out and claim that everyone does it is concerning. It’s very misleading,” he said. Even more concerning is that he said FlySafair applies dirty tricks to ensure passengers in overbooked flights are left stranded. “If you have a long check-in queue, the airline can manipulate the system,” Van Der Molen said in the Biznews interview. “If they know the flight is overbooked, they can manage the check-in rate to achieve the outcome they want. But that’s not ethical.” When this happens, they do not have to compensate customers, which bolster the bottom line. BusinessTech asked FlySafair for comment about the accusations, but the company preferred not to comment.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/807124/warning-for-taxi-owners-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:19:20+00:00,,Warning for taxi owners in South Africa,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 16 Jan 2025 Motoring Warning for taxi owners in South Africa Malcolm Libera · 16 Jan 2025 A concerning trend of taxi operators intimidating private vehicles transporting passengers has emerged in South Africa, prompting stern warnings from authorities. The Eastern Cape Department of Transport recently addressed reports of taxi drivers harassing private scholar transport operators. Allegedly, taxi operators have not only demanded money from these contractors but also actively barred them from dropping children off at schools, particularly in the Mthatha area. Horatio Hendricks of the Democratic Alliance expressed deep concern over these actions, describing them as disruptive, unlawful, and traumatising for the children involved. He emphasised that taxi operators have no legal authority to interfere with other transport providers or dictate who may transport learners. Hendricks stressed the need for children’s safety and education to remain a priority, condemning actions that place undue strain on parents and disrupt students’ ability to attend school on time. The issue isn’t confined to the Eastern Cape. In Limpopo, taxi associations reportedly issued notices instructing employers and schools to ensure employees and learners exclusively use taxis for commuting. A signed notice circulating on social media in October 2024 announced the enforcement of this rule from 1 November. Such moves have alarmed the public, especially following videos in other parts of the county of taxi association patrols terrorising drivers who gave lifts to pedestrians, hitchhikers, or even family members. Defending these patrols, the South African National Taxi Council’s (Santaco’s) Mpumalanga chairperson, Fanyana Sibanyoni, claimed they were for security purposes, stating, “Every company has the right to have security to look after their businesses.” Sibanyoni further argued that private car owners lacked permits to transport passengers and were infringing on taxi operators’ rights. However, national police commissioner Fanie Masemola clarified that these patrollers have no legal authority to stop or fine motorists. “They can stop their own taxis but cannot interfere with members of the public,” he affirmed. Stefanie Fick from the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) echoed this sentiment, condemning the patrollers’ actions as harassment and extortion. Fick highlighted that patrollers have no legal standing to pull over vehicles or demand fines, as law enforcement duties lie with the South African Police Service and metro police departments. Fick also pointed out that the white lights taxi patrols use are regulated under the National Road Traffic Regulations. These lights are reserved for registered security providers conducting lawful activities, which patrollers’ actions do not qualify as. She urged motorists to safely evade these patrols and report incidents to the police. According to her, patrols’ demands for fines constitute extortion, necessitating immediate law enforcement intervention to prevent such practices. This growing issue underscores the need for urgent action to safeguard motorists’ rights and ensure passengers’ safety. While the taxi industry plays a critical role in South Africa’s transport sector, its operators must adhere to the law. Intimidation, harassment, and illegal roadblocks only exacerbate the challenges faced by parents, learners, and other transport providers, calling for stricter enforcement and accountability to restore public trust and safety on the roads.

The Automobile Association (AA) and road safety experts are sounding the alarm over this dangerous crime trend, which primarily affects drivers in Gauteng but has also been reported in other provinces. Criminals employ spikes to puncture vehicle tyres, forcing drivers to stop and rendering them vulnerable to robbery, assault, or hijacking. Eleanor Mavimbela, spokesperson for the AA, explains that these incidents often occur in low-visibility areas, such as under bridges or on poorly lit roads, particularly at night. Social media has been inundated with reports of motorists falling victim to this tactic, highlighting its growing prevalence. Criminals work in pairs or small groups, strategically placing spikes to deflate tyres and then exploiting the immobilised vehicle. In response, the AA strongly advises motorists to avoid travelling at night, stay vigilant in high-risk areas, and refrain from stopping immediately if their tyres are spiked. Instead, drivers should maintain a reduced speed and continue to a safer location before stopping to assess the damage and seek help. The criminals’ modus operandi has evolved as motorists become more cautious. Initially, spikes were concealed on roads, and criminals would wait in nearby bushes for vehicles to hit them and stop. However, as drivers learned to avoid stopping, perpetrators began adapting their tactics. Now, some criminals use their own vehicles, often stolen, to follow targeted motorists until they’re forced to pull over. Others lay clothing or objects over spikes to deceive drivers into believing a person is on the road. The situation has also become increasingly violent, with reports of victims being assaulted, raped, or even forced to withdraw cash from ATMs after being robbed. To mitigate the risk, the AA emphasises the importance of adhering to speed limits, maintaining a safe following distance, and informing someone of your travel plans, especially when driving through unfamiliar areas. While run-flat tyres offer some protection, even standard tyres can last longer than expected if the driver keeps moving at a reduced speed, potentially allowing them to reach a safer location. The Motor Industry Staff Association’s (MISA) Sonja Carstens warns that criminals’ willingness to escalate their aggression underscores the importance of vigilance. She notes that while increased police visibility in some areas has helped, incidents remain alarmingly common. Specific hotspot routes have been identified, including: The N4 freeway between Donkerhoek and Bronkhorstspruit. The R104 . The N1 between Midrand and the Soweto turnoff. The R80 Mabopane Freeway in Pretoria. On the N4, criminals have reportedly thrown rocks onto the road to force drivers to stop, while similar incidents involving spikes and other debris have occurred on other major routes. Even in areas where police patrols have increased, such as parts of Johannesburg, attacks continue to pose a serious threat. Just last week, rocks damaged vehicles on the N1 and N7 near the city. Journalist and activist Yusuf Abramjee has been vocal about the need for coordinated efforts to combat this crime. Private security companies and community police forums are working alongside law enforcement to clear roads and improve safety in known hotspots. While these efforts are commendable, Abramjee stresses the importance of maintaining personal vigilance and staying informed about high-risk areas. Motorists should remain cautious and prepared to respond to potential encounters with road-spiking criminals. The alarming increase in road-spiking incidents is a stark reminder of the challenges South African motorists face daily. While authorities and community groups continue to address the issue, drivers must prioritize their safety by avoiding risky situations and following expert advice.

This is according to the 2024 INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard, which looks at transportation data and trends among 946 urban areas analysed worldwide. “Traffic can also be seen as a barometer for the economy. The movement of people, goods and services creates demand for road travel, but when demand exceeds the supply of road space, it results in congestion,” said INRIX “This means that while traffic congestion has a negative impact on the economy, it’s a symptom of economic activity.” Commute times are also calculated by looking exclusively at the time it takes to get to and from major employment centres within an urban area from surrounding commuting neighbourhoods. Looking at South Africa, residents in Cape Town lost 94 hours due to traffic. This is far above second-placed Johannesburg, where residents lost 55 hours due to traffic. Pretoria completes the top three, with 45 hours lost due to residents in traffic. Durban (35 hours), Pietermaritzburg (33 hours), Port Elizabeth/Gqeberha (30 hours) and East London (27 hours) also see over a day lost per year due to traffic. On the other end of the scale, Welkom sees only six hours lost to traffic each year. Ten Highest Traffic Delay Times By South Africa City Making the top 10 Overall, Istanbul, Turkiyë completes the list of the most congested urban areas, with road users losing 105 hours to traffic as delays increased by 15% from 2023 This was more than New York and Chicago’s 102 hours lost to traffic. London road users also used 101 hours of traffic At 97 hours of traffic, Paris tied for fifth with Mexico City. Cape Town’s 94 hours saw it take the number seven spot, with more time lost to traffic than Los Angeles’s 88 hours. These large delays have a profound economic impact, with data from the USA, UK and Germany highlighting the cost of traffic. The average U.S. driver lost 43 hours to traffic congestion, which was equivalent to a full work week. This led to $771 worth of time lost. In the U.K., drivers lost an average of 61 hours commuting to work, or about £581 in lost time, whereas the average German driver lost 43 hours in traffic jams, equal to 470 € per driver. “Telecommuting dropped 8% in the U.S. while remote & hybrid work stayed relatively stagnant in the U.K. Of the large urban metro areas, tech-heavy San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle saw the largest drops in telecommuting,” said INRIX. “The influx of workers may be having an effect during off-work hours as well. Trips to U.S. downtowns grew faster on weekends, and especially weekend nights, than weekdays.” “This could indicate a shift toward increased downtown viability and vibrance in the wake of COVID-19’s damaging effect on office-heavy downtowns.” Ten Highest Traffic Delay Times By Cities Worldwide Read : All the bank branches where South Africans can get a new passport and smart ID Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Business · 55m The iconic 113-year-old South African brand that made a huge comeback after disappearing twice Business Opinion · 3h Big change coming for smoking in South Africa Business · 3h Good news for Discovery medical aid members told to pay back thousands in claims Government · 6h Meet America’s new top official in South Africa Lifestyle · 9h Warning for matrics in South Africa Government · 21h ANC wants to expropriate land without paying for it Industry News Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa Partner content Codehesion can build a world-class smartphone app for your business in 2026 Partner content Enhancing post-retirement income with discretionary solutions Partner content Standard Bank representative office first to be re-licensed under Ethiopia’s new banking proclamation More News Property · 23h End of an era for one of South Africa’s most iconic developments Lifestyle · 1d Gym prices in 2026: Virgin Active vs Planet Fitness Technology · 10 Jan 2026 Warning for anyone using WhatsApp in South Africa Business Opinion · 10 Jan 2026 The death spiral South Africa urgently needs to escape Government · 10 Jan 2026 All the bank branches where South Africans can get a Smart ID and passport Government · 9 Jan 2026 Huge problem hitting one of South Africa’s most volatile provinces Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

This has created a dangerous situation where traffic lights are sabotaged to generate income. MasterDrive CEO Eugene Herbert said residents have pointed out that certain traffic lights are disabled during daylight hours and are back on again at night. “No official action or confirmation of this was issued. Whether suspicions are true or not, drivers should be particularly wary of following the directions of illegal pointsmen,” said Herbert. “It is extremely dangerous for untrained individuals to direct traffic in some of the busiest and most complex intersections in South Africa. “Official pointsmen and traffic officers receive training to safely direct drivers and decrease the risk of collision [and] illegal pointsmen have neither the training nor the authority to do the same,” added the MasterDrive CEO. This has been particularly pertinent in the country’s economic hub. The City of Johannesburg has asked motorists not to tip illegal pointsmen. “If they are involved in disconnecting the lights, removing the financial benefit will discourage this,” said Herbert. “This can be difficult as there are reports that some illegal pointsmen get aggressive and even violent if not tipped.” He suggested that drivers anticipate traffic conditions to limit the time they are stationary, leave larger following distances or spaces between their vehicles and the ones in front, and keep windows closed and valuables out of sight to limit interactions with illegal pointsmen. Additionally, it is recommended that the authorities handle the issues and avoid initiating negative contact. Herbert urged drivers to not give illegal pointsmen the same faith and trust that you would give trained officials. “Even those with training in alleviating traffic flow recognise there is higher risk of collisions under manual direction. Never proceed through an intersection with blind trust,” said the MasterDrive CEO. “Check all directions as you would if there was no one directing traffic. “Remember, an illegal pointsman has no legal authority either. If you proceed despite seeing a potential collision, neither authorities nor insurers will care that you were directed to do so by an illegal pointsman,” he added. In theory, one should ignore directions from illegal pointsmen as they have no authority. In reality, however, this can be difficult. “When there are drivers following their directions, it may result in a situation where not following the traffic flow can be more dangerous [so] wherever possible, treat intersections without traffic lights as a four-way stop,” said Herbert. He said that if surrounding drivers follow directions of the illegal pointsmen making it difficult to stop, follow the flow of traffic while being extremely cautious. Slow down as much as possible and check all directions for drivers who are ignoring the directions. Herbert emphasised that while some intentions may be positive, an illegal pointsman has no authority or training to manage intersections. “The correct response can be difficult to decide on as it is unique to each situation.” “Make the most informed decision possible with the understanding that intersections without working traffic lights should be treated as four-way stops if there is no official pointsman directing traffic,” said the MasterDrive CEO.

According to the latest stats by Naamsa, aggregate industry sales reached 41,273 units, a 2.5% increase compared to December 2023. Although this was a welcome surge, it was not enough to give the industry the boost, it needed, as total aggregate vehicle sales for the year declined by 3% to 515,712 units. Automotive Business Council Naamsa said that this downturn reflects the broader economic challenges faced by the country in 2024. Passenger car sales offered some hope, as they saw a 1.1% increase for the year. However, all commercial vehicle segments saw declines. The December growth was mainly driven by an 8.2% rise in passenger car sales, with the rental industry playing a huge role. When it comes to the economic environment, Naamsa noted that several Chinese brands are gaining market share, as they offer more affordable prices. These affordable prices are bringing in consumers who are battling a tough economic climate. Sector 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2024 / 2023 % Change Cars 246,541 304,338 363,682 347,379 351,302 +1.1% Light Commercials 110,912 133,078 135,711 151,490 133,254 -12% Medium Commercials 6,735 7,520 8,308 8,252 7,714 -6.5% Heavy Trucks, Buses 16,018 19,555 21,841 24,654 23,442 -4,9% Total Vehicles 380,206 464,491 529,542 531,775 515,712 -3,0% Top brands Naamsa’s data also looked at the best-selling car brands in South Africa, with some interesting trends. Looking at the local market, Toyota remained supreme when it came to local car sales, registering 11,442 sales in December. Volkswagen came second with 4,832 units, while Suzuki was a close third with 4,514 units. There was another big drop off to the fourth place Hyundai, which sold 2,826 new cars during the month. Notably, as mentioned by Naamsa, Chinese brands climbed the rankings. Chery sold 1,867 units over the period, while GWM sold 1,686 units. The Chinese brands combined sold over 3,500 new cars in South Africa. Looking back to the same figures in December 2023 , Haval, which is now part of GWM, was the only Chinese manufacturer to feature in the top 10, with 1,480 units sold. The growing prevalence of Chinese brands can thus be seen in the latest sales data. The top 10 brands that sold the most cars locally in December 2024 were: Toyota – 11 422 units Volkswagen – 4 832 units Suzuki – 4 514 units Hyundai – 2 826 units Ford – 2 607 units Chery –1 867 units GWM – 1 686 units KIA – 1,496 units Isuzu – 1 364 units Renault – 1 105 units Read : Why kissing the dollar goodbye is not as simple as it seems Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Business Opinion · 58m In contemplation of Sapiens – the species and the book 5 Things · 1h Prime interest rate ‘cartel’ investigation in South Africa, and South African retail giant in hot water Business · 2h Jobs in South Africa that don’t need experience or qualifications Lifestyle · 16h Unique South African school achieves 100% university exemption and 4.4 distinctions per student Energy · 17h South Africans to pay for R76 billion mistake Government · 18h Dark times ahead for an important South African industry Industry News Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines More News Finance · 19h Tax return warning for over 500,000 taxpayers in South Africa Business · 20h R17 billion boost for South African-born billionaire since the start of 2026 Government · 22h Europe gives South Africa the green light Business · 23h Tax disaster for one of South Africa’s major employers 5 Things · 1d South Africans must still use Post Office for parcels under 1kg, and SAPS in deep trouble Business · 1d Store cheaper than Checkers and Pick n Pay launches nationwide delivery Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

Aggregate industry sales reached 41,273 units, a 2.5% increase compared to December 2023. However, despite this late surge, it was not enough to give the industry the boost that it needed. Total aggregate vehicle sales for the year declined by 3% to 515,712 units, marking the lowest point since the COVID-19 pandemic. Automotive Business Council Naamsa said that this downturn reflects the broader economic challenges faced by the country in 2024. Passenger car sales offered a glimmer of hope, recording a 1.1% increase for the year, while all commercial vehicle segments experienced declines. The December growth was primarily fueled by an 8.2% rise in passenger car sales, with the rental industry playing a significant role. Sector 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2024 / 2023 % Change Cars 246,541 304,338 363,682 347,379 351,302 +1.1% Light Commercials 110,912 133,078 135,711 151,490 133,254 -12% Medium Commercials 6,735 7,520 8,308 8,252 7,714 -6.5% Heavy Trucks, Buses 16,018 19,555 21,841 24,654 23,442 -4,9% Total Vehicles 380,206 464,491 529,542 531,775 515,712 -3,0% According to Naamsa, several factors contributed to the overall decline in new vehicle sales in 2024: Economic slowdown: The South African economy faced a challenging year, impacting consumer confidence and purchasing power. Naamsa said that the industry anticipated a year of two halves with a taxing first half of the year and with brighter economic prospects and an upswing in new vehicle sales during the second half of the year. This did not materialise as new vehicle sales remained under pressure in 2024. Naamsa continued to reflect a shift in the matrix with various “new entrants in the domestic market, in particular Chinese brands, offering options at the more affordable end of the pricing spectrum as consumers battled a tough economic climate.” Market disruptions: Naamsa emphasises a significant market disruption in the South African automative industry, putting new vehicle sales under pressure. Plummeting Exports: Vehicle exports declined significantly in 2024, dropping by 22.8% to 308,830 units. This decline was attributed to factors like a slowdown in demand in the European Union, stricter emission rules, competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicle imports, and timing effects of new model introductions in the domestic market. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Hope remains December 2024 saw a positive trend, with three consecutive months of year-on-year sales increases. This growth can be attributed to: Strong Seasonal sales: The December period typically sees a surge in vehicle sales, particularly to the rental industry. Easing inflation and interest rate cuts: Two interest rate cuts towards the end of 2024, coupled with easing inflation, created a more favourable economic environment, boosting consumer confidence and disposable income. Challenges and opportunities for 2025 While the December sales figures provide a positive note, the industry faces several challenges and opportunities in 2025: Local and global uncertainties : Factors like local wage negotiations, US policy shifts, oil price volatility, and geopolitical tensions may impact the market. Affordability concerns : Consumers’ growing price sensitivity is shifting demand toward smaller, affordable cars or quality used vehicles, pressuring retailer profits. Growth in Hybrid Vehicles : Rising petrol prices and increasing interest in sustainability are driving the growth of hybrid vehicles. Competition from Chinese Brands : The continued rise of affordable Chinese vehicles will push established manufacturers to adjust pricing strategies. Despite the challenges, Naamsa said that there are reasons for cautious optimism in 2025. Positive economic indicators and the resilience of the passenger car segment suggest a potential rebound. Factors like further interest rate cuts, easing energy constraints, and ongoing reforms in key sectors like electricity and transport could contribute to improved economic growth, projected at around 1.5% for 2025. This growth could translate into a single-digit improvement in the new vehicle market compared to 2024 levels. However, Naamsa said that the industry’s success in 2025 will depend on its ability to navigate these challenges and capitalise on emerging opportunities. Adapting to evolving consumer preferences, particularly the focus on affordability and sustainable solutions, will be key for sustained growth.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/804811/11-cheapest-automatic-cars-in-south-africa/,2026-01-18T00:19:40+00:00,,11 cheapest automatic cars in South Africa,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 8 Jan 2025 Motoring 11 cheapest automatic cars in South Africa Malcolm Libera · 8 Jan 2025 Automatic cars have long been considered a luxury in South Africa, but there are now 11 models priced under R275,000, making them more accessible to drivers. With the country’s diverse terrains and heavy traffic, these vehicles offer practical daily commuting and long-distance travel solutions. The convenience of automatic transmissions is undeniable. Unlike manual cars, they eliminate the need to juggle a clutch and shift gears, making them ideal for navigating urban congestion or hilly landscapes. This simplicity is particularly beneficial for new drivers, allowing them to concentrate on the road without the added stress of gear changes. In stop-and-go traffic, common in South African cities, automatic cars help reduce driver fatigue by removing the constant need to engage gears. The result is a more relaxed and comfortable driving experience, especially over long distances. Modern automatic vehicles also boast improved fuel efficiency compared to older models. Technological advances enable manufacturers to design systems that optimize gear shifts based on driving conditions, leading to better fuel economy. In a country where fuel prices continue to climb, these savings are a significant advantage, making automatic cars an economically attractive choice for many. Despite the perception that automatic cars are associated with high-end models, the availability of affordable options has grown. This shift is timely, as finance experts recommend spending no more than 25% of one’s monthly net income on vehicle-related expenses. With the average salary in South Africa reported at R28,220 per month by Stats SA, many workers can allocate up to R7,055 monthly to car costs, putting these 11 automatic cars within reach for a substantial portion of the population. Among the noteworthy options is Mahindra’s newly launched XUV 3XO, which entered the South African market on September 19, 2024. As a replacement for the outgoing XUV300, this crossover starts at R254,999, making it R23,000 cheaper than its predecessor. Buyers can choose from eight variants, with prices ranging up to R404,999, and select between a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. The automatic models feature driving modes such as Zip, Zap, and Zoom, designed to enhance performance across various terrains. WesBank’s vehicle finance calculator provides helpful estimates for prospective buyers considering financing. Assuming no deposit and a 0% balloon payment over five years at an interest rate of 11.25%, monthly repayments for the automatic cars in this price range fall between R4,313 and R6,109. These calculations make automatic vehicles not only practical but also financially attainable for many South Africans. The 11 cheapest automatic cars that you can buy brand new in South Africa are listed below.

The Cape Town Grand Prix SA (CTGPSA) plans to submit a bid to South Africa’s Bid Steering Committee (BSC) for the return of F1 to the country. Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Gayton McKenzie previously announced the intention to bring back Formula 1 to the country, CTGPSA has proposed an F1 street race in the Green Point Sport Tourism Precinct in Cape Town, with a 5.7km street circuit around the DHL Stadium. It added that the concept aligns with the global appeal of F1 street circuits, with the F1 calendar having street races in Monaco, Singapore, Baku, Las Vegas and Miami. The group previously received an official letter from Sports Promotion, Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport, Mr TD Tutu, to host the F1 Grand Prix Series on a street circuit in Cape Town. It then built on this success by securing an official letter from the Western Cape government’s Provincial Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sport, Ms Anroux Marais, to host a Formula E race on the same circuit. The Formula E race took place at the Green Point Sport Tourism Precinct in 2023. CTGPSA added that its collaboration with F1 Circuit Designers & Consultants and the support from local and international partners underlines the value of the intellectual property we’ve cultivated over the years. In a letter to CTGPSA CEO, Igshaan Amlay, Mckenzie acknowledged the interest in holding an F1 Grand Prix in Cape Town and said that a thorough review process will take place. “Having seen 2024 culminate on such a positive and hopeful note after a 19-year stakeholder engagement journey, gives us a renewed resolve to take the next steps in this formal bidding process,” said Amlay. “With the continued support from our local and international supporters and F1 enthusiasts, we are ready to bring an F1 street race to our spectacularly located circuit in the Green Point Sport Tourism Precinct in Cape Town, South Africa.” The Proposed F1 Street Circuit in Cape Town Economic boost On top of the excitement that F1 fans will bring to the event, there are economic benefits to hosting large events. NWU economics professor Waldo Krugell previously said that major events, such as F1, can lead to additional spending, aiding economic growth. In his example, Krugell noted how Taylor Swift’s concerts in Singapore were set to increase the island’s GDP growth from 2.5% to 2.9% in the first quarter of 2024. Cape Town’s 2023 Formula E race was estimated to generate over R1 billion in economic impact. CTGPSA will face competition from other tracks, with McKenzie previously revealing that a purpose-built racetrack is currently under construction in Cape Town adjacent to the Fisantekraal airport. Cape Town will face competition from Johannesburg, with the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit preparing to meet the requirements for an F1 race. F1 last held a race in South Africa at the Kyalami circuit in 1993. McKenzie said that Kyalami is set to upgrade its facilities to reach FIA Grade 1 accreditation, which is the standard required for hosting an F1 event.

Since debuting in April 2023 and April 2024, respectively, the Omoda and Jaecoo have rapidly gained traction in the local market. By October, they impressively climbed to 15th place in the national sales rankings out of more than 50 manufacturers. Riding this momentum, Chery aims to bolster its lineup to capture even more market share. Two new models from Omoda and four additions from Jaecoo will headline Chery’s ambitious product rollout for next year. Leading the charge for Omoda is the all-new C7, which slots between the compact C5 and the flagship C9 in the brand’s SUV range. The C7 is distinguished by its bold design, featuring a frameless X-shaped grille and sleek, flowing headlights that accentuate its sporty, modern look. With a length of 4,621mm and a wheelbase of 2,700mm, it rivals popular mid-size SUVs like the Toyota RAV4. Inside, the C7 offers a premium experience with leather upholstery, a large 15.6-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and an immersive 14-speaker sound system. Omoda C7 Omoda is also making its first entry into the hybrid market with the launch of the C9 plug-in hybrid (PHEV). While the petrol-powered C9, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine producing 192kW and 400Nm, is already available, the upcoming PHEV version is set to broaden the vehicle’s appeal. This variant features a smaller 1.5-litre engine paired with up to three electric motors, offering a blend of efficiency and performance. Though exact specifications for the South African market have yet to be confirmed, Omoda promises the C9 PHEV will deliver a luxury driving experience while remaining sustainable and refined. Jaecoo, on the other hand, is preparing an even bigger product onslaught for 2025, starting with its entry-level J5. Designed to be Jaecoo’s most affordable model, the J5 adopts a rugged aesthetic similar to its larger sibling, the J7, with striking vertical grille slats and squared-off proportions that combine urban sophistication with off-road toughness. Inside, the J5 doesn’t skimp on features, boasting a 13.2-inch touchscreen and the largest panoramic sunroof in its class, measuring 1.45m². Additional highlights include advanced climate control, a high-efficiency air filtration system, and optional pet-friendly accessories catering to a variety of lifestyles. Jaecoo J5 Jaecoo is also set to make waves in the electric vehicle space with the launch of the all-electric J6. Positioned as a premium crossover, the J6 brings a compelling mix of capability and technology. Internationally, it is offered in two powertrain options: a two-wheel-drive version delivering 184kW and 220Nm, and a more robust four-wheel-drive variant with 279kW and 385Nm. Luxury touches abound inside the cabin, including electrically adjustable and massaging front seats, along with a large 15.6-inch infotainment display. Final specifications for the South African market will be revealed closer to its release. Jaecoo J6 The popular J7 range will also receive an upgrade with the introduction of a plug-in hybrid version. Currently available only as a petrol-powered model, the J7 PHEV showcases impressive efficiency, having completed a 1,300km endurance test in China with an average fuel consumption of just 3.3L/100km—far lower than its official 5.99L/100km figure. The vehicle also claims an electric-only range of 90km, but real-world testing revealed an even better result of 125.2km. Jaecoo has noted that these figures could differ slightly for the South African market but remains confident in the model’s performance and efficiency. Rounding out Jaecoo’s lineup for next year is the range-topping J8, which will serve as the brand’s flagship SUV. Designed to accommodate up to seven passengers, the J8 combines spaciousness with power, courtesy of its 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine producing 195kW and 400Nm. Measuring 4,815mm in length, 1,924mm in width, and 1,710mm in height, it will be one of the larger SUVs in its class, offering a commanding presence on the road.

Three Chinese automakers have already signed non-disclosure agreements with the Automotive Business Council, Chief Executive Officer Mikel Mabasa said, declining to identify them. “With good government policies we will attract new investment, we will increase and retain investment,” Mabasa said in an interview on Friday. Enabling a 150% tax deduction on investment in electric- and hydrogen-powered vehicle production comes as Chinese automakers are taking Africa’s biggest car market by storm. Vehicles made by Chery Automobile Co. and Great Wall Motor Co. are increasingly competing with those from the local manufacturing units of carmakers such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG. In December, Chinese ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng said his government was encouraging automakers to invest in the country. While the industry has welcomed the step, it comes after years of warnings that car making, the jewel in South Africa’s manufacturing sector, is at risk because of legislation in its biggest export market — the European Union — aimed at phasing out the use of internal-combustion engines. The tax amendment, first proposed in the national budget in February last year, was only enacted by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Dec. 24. While some companies including Ford Motor Co. and BMW AG make or plan to manufacture hybrids in the country, none have announced planned investment in battery-electric vehicles. The local heads of Volkswagen and Isuzu Motors Ltd. have said they don’t see a likelihood of their companies making EVs in South Africa. Stellantis NV said it plans to once the operating environment is conducive. While the uptake of electric vehicles in developed markets such as the EU and US has been slower than expected, South Africa needs to start producing them to keep its place in the global industry, Mabasa said. Additional investment in charging-station networks, developing a supply chain that uses southern Africa’s mineral wealth and reducing taxes on car sales are all needed, said Mike Whitfield, the head of Stellantis sub-Saharan Africa. Investment Decision The tax amendment “cannot and will not on its own be sufficient,” he said in an interview. Other steps are needed because “it’s not the only thing that can confirm an investment decision.” South Africa is the world’s biggest producer of manganese, mines nickel and has deposits of rare earths — all key components in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles. It’s also the largest miner of platinum, used in the fuel cells that power hydrogen-fueled vehicles. At the same time, local sales make up a large component of automaker revenue and import levies on electric cars — together with an ad-valorem tax that was originally intended for luxury vehicles — haven’t been adjusted for decades. “We’ve shot our first warning bullet at government,” Mabasa said, noting that levies are higher than in other emerging markets. The ad-valorem tax level should move “in line with inflation or they should get rid of it,” he said. While South Africa remains the most attractive place for automaker investment on the continent given its infrastructure and relatively affluent consumer base, the industry needs more support, Mabasa said. “If government is not supportive the industry will die,” he said.

In the Cirium 2024 On-Time Performance Review, FlySafair was named the leading on-time airline in the Middle East and Africa region in 2024. The airline achieved an impressive 93.82% of flights arriving on schedule, highlighting its operational excellence and reliability, and solidifying its status as a standout carrier in a competitive industry. “This achievement is particularly significant for South African aviation, positioning the country as a leader in dependable air travel within the continent,” said Cirium. “South Africa’s advanced infrastructure and strategic location have long made it a key aviation hub, connecting intra-African routes and international markets.” “FlySafair’s success not only enhances its own reputation but also reinforces South Africa’s role as a trailblazer in raising standards and fostering growth in the region on multiple fronts.” FlySafair’s commitment to punctuality was clearly evident as it was named the most on-time regional carrier in 11 out of 12 months in 2024 by Cirium. “Through investments in data-driven practices, advanced scheduling, and fleet management, the airline has minimized delays and reduced travel disruptions for passengers,” said Cirium. “Close collaboration with ground handling teams and air traffic management has further ensured seamless operations.” “Despite challenges such as rising operational costs, volatile jet fuel prices, and currency pressures, FlySafair has maintained its resilience through strategic initiatives.” “Refining its route network, optimizing fleet efficiency, and prioritizing operational excellence have been key factors in its success.” Cirium added that FlySafair’s leadership in on-time performance should be seen as a benchmark for the MEA region. This is particularly impressive as the region faces diverse challenges, such as infrastructure gaps, regulatory complexities, and geopolitical instability. Source: Cirium FlySafair’s troubles The ratings come amidst a tough period for the group, with South Africa’s Air Services Licensing Council ruling that the group does not comply with the Air Services Licensing Act. The law states that domestic airlines must have at least 75% local ownership. The International Air Services Act requires substantial local shareholding, which is widely accepted to be above 50%. FlySafair is currently 74.86% owned by ASL Aviation Group, an Irish aviation services holding company focused on cargo and passenger airline operations. The company structure comprises a 49.86% shareholding by the Safair Investment Trust, which is 100% owned by ASL, as well as a 25% direct ASL shareholding. Near the end of last year, the International Air Services Council (IASC) ruled that FlySafair’s shareholding structure was not compliant with South African law. The IASC stated that the airline failed to apply for an amendment of its air service licence when its ownership structure changed in March 2019. The international body said that it would announce the planned sanction within the next few weeks. In a separate blow to FlySafair, South Africa’s Air Services Licensing Council has also ruled that FlySafair does not comply with the Air Services Licensing Act. In response, FlySafair said that it believes that its structure and operations align with the required legal provisions. “While these recent findings challenge our understanding, we remain steadfast in our commitment to compliance,” said FlySafair FlySafair added it was confident that this issue could be resolved amicably through dialogue and cooperation.

City of Johannesburg MMC for Public Safety, Mgcini Tshwaku, said criminals deliberately place rocks on the N1 North between the Soweto Highway and Maraisburg Off-ramps. Another hotspot for this criminal activity is the N1 South between Maraisburg and Rand Show Road Off-ramps. Although spiking can happen at any time in the day, it most often occurs after dark because it helps with this type of crime. Criminals take advantage of the darkness to hide hazards from unsuspecting drivers until it’s too late for them to brake or avoid the objects. Criminals aim to damage a vehicle, especially its tyres, which causes the driver to pull over, making them vulnerable to robbery. Although thieves mainly use spikes made from wood or nails, they can also use other big objects, such as rocks. “We have directed the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) and the South African Police Service (SAPS) to act decisively to root out these criminal elements,” said Tshwaku. “Joint operations are underway across our freeways and highways, ensuring no road user is vulnerable.” “Department of Public Safety is aware of the alarming rise in road spike incidents across Johannesburg and is dealing with it decisively to ensure the safety of all motorists.” The city urged the community to report emergencies or suspicious activities by contacting 082 060 0057 or 011 375 5911. Spiking is not a new tactic, with numerous incidents reported in recent years. Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and People with Disabilities of South Africa Sindisiwe Chikunga was a victim of spiking hijacking in late 2023. The Gauteng Traffic Police previously identified the following roads as spiking hotspots: N4 Mpumalanga to Pretoria between Solomon Mahlangu and Watermeyer off-ramp. N4 Pretoria to Mpumalanga between Bronkhorstspruit and Balmoral off-ramp. N1 Polokwane N4 Mpumalanga interchange in Pretoria. N4 to Rustenburg between R80 Mabopane Freeway and Brits Plaza tollgate. Golden Highway. R21 Freeway from OR Tambo International Airport to Pretoria. R562 in Olifantsfontein N12 in Witbank, under the Merridale bridge N12 between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom N3 between Leondale and Barry Marais Road N17 between Rondebult and Heidelberg Road Hijacking tactics on the rise Spiking is one of the many tactics criminals use to target South African motorists and steal their belongings. For instance, 2024 saw the re-emergence of the ‘tap-tap’ hijacking tactic. In this method, criminals intentionally bump into a victim’s car to create a staged accident. Once the driver pulls over to assess the damage or exchange details, hijackers use the opportunity to strike. This trend is popular in urban areas, where congested roads allow criminals to exploit unsuspecting drivers. Car theft and hijacking claims for high-value vehicles have also increased, especially keyless models. Criminals have increasingly turned to sophisticated car-jamming techniques which disable remote locking systems. Moreover, there has been a rise in kidnappings during hijackings. Criminals hold the victim hostage to ensure that the tracking devices are revealed and delay the reporting of the crime. Hijackers can thus remove or disable the devices before the vehicle is reported stolen, making recovery incredibly difficult.

According to market intelligence group Lightstone , cars manufactured on the South Asian sub-continent from brands like Suzuki and Toyota, and other like French multinational automobile manufacturer Renault are set to outshine others in terms of holding their value. This trend has been shaped by consumer choices, particularly in the under-R300,000 segment, which has become a focal point of the market. Cars produced on the South Asian subcontinent accounted for an impressive 70% of the 108,000 light vehicles sold in South Africa for under R300,000. Suzuki dominated this segment with a 43% share, followed by Renault at 19% and Toyota at 17%. Lightstone’s residual value forecasting tool highlights the attractiveness of these Indian-built vehicles, predicting an average value retention rate of 86% for 2025. For context, a car purchased for R300,000 in this category would still be worth approximately R258,000 after a year, assuming average mileage and maintenance. This minimal depreciation, a mere 14% loss, underscores why Indian-built cars are capturing the attention of budget-conscious South Africans. Close behind are locally manufactured vehicles, which boast a retention rate of 85.8%, showcasing the strength of South Africa’s domestic automotive industry. Chinese-built cars are also making strides, with a projected retention rate of 83.9%, followed by South Korean vehicles at 83.6%. These forecasts are provided that the vehicles are within the average mileage and condition parameters for their age. These figures reflect a broader trend where affordability and quality are increasingly aligning, allowing a more diverse range of consumers access to durable and cost-effective vehicles. The surge in interest in Indian- and Chinese-made vehicles comes against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment. Suzuki Fronx In 2024, South African car prices have risen at rates well above inflation, exacerbating affordability issues for many consumers. Industry experts attribute these price increases to a combination of global and local factors, including supply chain disruptions, the depreciation of the rand, and rising input costs for materials and manufacturing. Additionally, stringent emissions regulations and increased import duties have compounded the cost pressures, leaving buyers with fewer affordable options in the new car market. This dynamic has made value retention an essential consideration for buyers. Cars that hold their value well not only offer better returns when resold but also provide a buffer against the steep financial hit typically associated with new vehicle purchases. Indian-built cars have emerged as a clear winner in this regard, blending affordability with strong resale prospects. Their increasing popularity underscores a shift in consumer priorities, with South Africans placing greater emphasis on long-term cost-effectiveness. Chinese-built vehicles are also gaining ground, thanks to improvements in build quality and competitive pricing strategies. Once met with scepticism, these cars are now recognised as viable alternatives in a market where every rand counts. The convergence of affordability and reliability in Indian and Chinese models is reshaping South Africa’s automotive landscape, offering a glimpse into the future of value-driven mobility. As economic pressures persist, the appeal of cars that combine reasonable purchase prices with robust resale value is unlikely to diminish. This trend marks a turning point for South Africa’s car market, highlighting the pivotal role of affordability in shaping consumer decisions and the broader automotive ecosystem.

However, this time of year also sees a surge in road accidents and incidents; adding to an already high road fatality rate, with over 10,100 deaths on the country’s roads in 2024 thus far. To help ensure a safe and enjoyable journey for everyone, Suzuki Auto South Africa, in partnership with FleetMax Africa, has released five S.M.A.R.T driving tips as part of their DriveSmart road-safety curriculum. These tips, focused on awareness, hazard management, distraction avoidance, responsible driving, and consideration for all road users, aim to equip motorists with the knowledge and skills to navigate the busy roads safely. Brendon Carpenter, Brand Marketing Manager of Suzuki Auto South Africa, said that “South Africans are particularly fond of a good road trip, especially as the year draws to a close.” “However, a quick look at historical road safety data shows a worryingly high percentage of these journeys don’t go according to plan, with many falling foul to road rage incidents, accidents or worse,” said Carpenter. He said that some these incidents are not only unnecessary but also avoidable. S.M.A.R.T driving tips for a safe journey: S – Scan: Constantly scan the road ahead for both moving and stationary hazards. Regularly check your rearview and side mirrors – every 5 to 8 seconds – and before braking. This helps assess the distance and speed of vehicles behind you. M – Manage: React to identified hazards swiftly and carefully by adjusting your speed or changing direction. Use your horn or flash your headlights to alert other drivers of potential dangers. The key is early identification and anticipation, which gives you more time and space to avoid collisions. A – Avoid: Distractions are a major cause of accidents, especially at higher speeds where reaction time is crucial. Be mindful of auditory distractions like loud music or conversations, physical distractions like using your phone or adjusting controls, and mental distractions like dwelling on thoughts unrelated to driving. R – Remember: Remember the 5 Cs of defensive driving: Concentration: Focus on driving and minimize distractions. Competency: Know your vehicle and operate it safely and efficiently. Compliance: Obey all traffic rules and regulations. Consideration: Be patient and avoid road rage. Communication: Use turn signals and hand signals to indicate your intentions clearly and in advance. T – Think: Prioritise the safety of all road users at all times. Adopt a mindful driving style to save money, reduce environmental impact, and reach your destination safely. Focus on reaching your destination and the loved ones waiting for you, ensuring a journey without regrets. Ashref Ismail, CEO of FleetMax Africa, emphasises the importance of patience and a relaxed approach to driving during the festive season. December and early January always see a considerable spike in traffic along the country’s major arterial roads. People tend to become impatient, trying to get to their destinations as quickly as they can. This is a recipe for disaster as many innocent lives are placed at risk,” he said. Ismail urges motorists to anticipate delays and enjoy the journey. “Be prepared for delays and enjoy the journey – South Africa is full of scenic drives that should not be rushed.” The two companies said that by following these S.M.A.R.T driving tips and embracing a patient and responsible approach to driving, South Africans can contribute to safer roads for everyone this festive season.

A province-wide survey by the Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) shows that the 16 million residents of the country’s economic powerhouse, Gauteng, are spending a notable amount more on transport than they did in 2017. The 2023/24 Quality of Life Index survey (QoL7) interviewed 13,795 respondents across 529 wards (every ward in Gauteng) to assess progress (or lack thereof) in several areas. According to the survey shows that in 2017, 12% of residents spent between R1,000 and R2,000 a month on transport, which increased to 17% six years later. In 2017 only 4% spent more than R2,000 a month, but that jumped to 13% by 2023. That means nearly one in three residents were spending more than R1,000 a month on transport last year. “Even taking into account inflation and the increasing cost of living in general this is still pretty steep,” said The Outlier , who in-depthly compared various years of these transportation insights. Graphic: The Outlier Looking at the range, residents in South Africa’s most populous province are spending between R0 and R9,500 a month on transport, with a median spend of R500. The 27% of Gautengers who said they primarily drove cars spent vastly different amounts monthly, but the median for car drivers sits at R2,000 a month. Continuing to rule the roost is minibus taxis, with nearly 38% of the residents surveyed indicating that this is their primary means of transport. The median spend of these taxis users was R350 a month, which is less than the median monthly spending of the bus and train users. Very few participants rely on buses and trains in the latest survey, which shows a lessening reliance on a lackluster public transportation system. Buses and trains were the main transport mode for less than 2% of the surveyed population in 2023/4. Ten years ago, the survey found that 7% used them. Graphic: The Outlier While minibus transport use sits top of the pile, it has also decreased in the past decade: 45% of respondents relied on these in 2013/14 and in the latest survey 38% did. Insted, more people are driving and walking. “Despite being one of the most expensive transport options, the proportion of people driving a private car has increased from 17% to 27% in the past 10 years,” explained The Outlier. “On the opposite side of the cost spectrum, the proportion of people who said walking was their primary means of getting around increased to 22% from 14% in 2013/14,” they added. Graphic: The Outlier Transport money The GCRO survey measures socio-economic status on a 1-to-10 scale, considering factors like income, employment, education, healthcare, and internet access. Transportation choices vary by socio-economic status, with higher income groups more likely to use private cars. However, even in lower income brackets, many individuals still choose to use private vehicles. Graphic: The Outlier What about e-hailing? Although ride-hailing services have transformed urban transport in South Africa, the latest survey reveals that a significant portion of Gauteng residents still rarely use e-hailing platforms. Two-thirds of respondents report never using these services, while occasional users typically rely on them only a few times per month. Frequent e-hailing users are often those who usually rely on minibus taxis, likely turning to ride-hailing options when these are unavailable.

According to the latest data from Stats SA’s Quarterly Employment Survey, the average monthly earnings for non-agricultural workers increased by 2.6% in the third quarter of 2024, rising from R27,511 in Q2 to R28,220. This growth was largely driven by gains in sectors such as business services, community services, mining, and electricity. However, even with this increase, only ten new cars remain affordable for individuals earning the average salary. The affordability of a car goes beyond its sticker price, as buyers must also account for fuel, insurance, and maintenance costs. WesBank estimates that the true cost of car ownership in South Africa has surged by an astonishing 50.6% since 2021. This spike is primarily due to persistently high inflation and escalating petrol prices. The financial strain has pushed many consumers towards older, more affordable used vehicles or alternative financing models, as noted by TransUnion in its latest report. The report highlights that economic pressures have squeezed lower-income buyers out of the market for new cars entirely, leaving them to seek cost-effective mobility solutions. Financing experts emphasise that individuals should allocate no more than 25% of their monthly income to vehicle-related expenses. For someone earning an average salary of R28,220, this translates to a budget of R7,055 per month for car costs, including instalments, insurance, and fuel. Given this guideline, the portion allocated solely to car repayments is typically capped at R5,500. At a financing rate of 12.50% over 60 months with no deposit or balloon payment, this cap equates to an affordable car price of roughly R240,000. While ten new cars remain within reach of this budget, the list is shrinking as vehicle prices continue to climb. Industry experts attribute this trend to multiple factors. Exchange rate fluctuations, for instance, have made imported vehicle components significantly more expensive. Coupled with supply chain disruptions, manufacturers face higher production costs, which are inevitably passed on to consumers. Additionally, high fuel prices contribute to the spiralling costs of car ownership. “The price of petrol remains a key driver of overall inflation,” notes Dawie Roodt, chief economist at Efficient Group. South Africa’s reliance on imported oil, coupled with a volatile rand, means that fuel costs are unlikely to stabilise soon. This affects consumers’ ability to manage monthly running costs, further reducing their willingness to commit to new vehicle purchases. For average earners in South Africa, the dream of owning a new car is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. Although the average salary has grown marginally, it has not kept pace with the escalating costs of vehicles and ownership. With limited options available within their price range, many are forced to consider used cars or alternative mobility solutions. As economic pressures persist, the affordability gap is likely to widen, making the market for new cars an increasingly exclusive one. There are currently only 10 cars priced under R240,000 in South Africa, and these are listed below with pricing and estimated monthly repayment amount.

Beginning in early 2023, this wave of discontinuations has seen several beloved models phased out, reshaping the market and leaving a mix of surprise, adaptation, and evolution in its wake. In 2023, South African motorists bid farewell to popular budget-friendly SUVs, including the Ford EcoSport, Suzuki Vitara Brezza, and Toyota Urban Cruiser. These models were staples in the sub-R300,000 SUV segment, offering affordability and versatility that resonated with a wide audience. News of their discontinuation sent ripples through the motoring community, as each had carved a niche in the local market. However, their respective manufacturers swiftly introduced replacements. Ford unveiled the Puma, Suzuki introduced the Grand Vitara, and Toyota launched a revamped Urban Cruiser. While the new Urban Cruiser shares its predecessor’s name, it is built on an entirely new platform, emphasizing a fresh start rather than a direct continuation. Other automakers also made notable exits. BAIC discontinued the X25, while Mahindra retired the KUV100 and KUV500, narrowing its lineup. Toyota bid adieu to the iconic FJ Cruiser, and Nissan removed the Almera, further diminishing the already limited pool of affordable sedans available locally. Hyundai followed suit by phasing out the Atos, making the Grand i10 its new entry-level offering. Toyota also replaced the Agya with the Vitz, which is now based on the Suzuki Celerio platform, reflecting an ongoing trend of platform sharing and strategic rebranding. In 2024, the pace of change accelerated, with at least 12 models being discontinued in the first 11 months alone. Subaru replaced the VX with the Crosstrek, and Kia confirmed the end of its Rio hatch production for right-hand-drive markets. Citroën took a bold step by revamping its entire lineup, switching from European imports to Indian-manufactured models. This transition meant the departure of the old European C3 and C3 Aircross, which were replaced by similarly named but distinctly different Indian versions. Honda also joined the movement, retiring the WR-V in favour of the Elevate, while Mahindra’s XUV300 gave way to the XUV300 TurboSport. Volkswagen ended production of its entry-level Amarok bakkie, marking a significant shift in its lineup. Similarly, models like the Hyundai Kona, Nissan Qashqai, Jeep Renegade, Mazda BT-50, and Toyota C-HR were pulled from showrooms, largely due to declining sales. Yet, exceptions to this trend emerged, such as the Nissan NP200. Despite being a strong seller, the compact bakkie was discontinued due to its ageing engineering—a decision that surprised many, given its ongoing popularity. Suzuki also decided to streamline its offerings, phasing out the Vitara. The company justified the move by pointing to its newer models, such as the Fronx and Grand Vitara, which now dominate its SUV lineup. This decision underscored a broader industry shift toward focusing on updated designs and modern engineering. The evolving automotive market continues to reflect shifting consumer demands, cost considerations, and the relentless pursuit of modernity, leaving a dynamic and ever-changing landscape in its wake. The 24 cars that have been discontinued in South Africa over the course of two years are listed below. 2023 BAIC X25 Ford EcoSport Hyundai Atos Kia Rio Mahindra KUV100 Mahindra XUV500 Nissan Almera Subaru XV Suzuki Vitara Brezza Toyota Agya Toyota FJ Cruiser Toyota Urban Cruiser 2024 Citroen C3 Citroen C3 Aircross Honda WR-V Hyundai Kona Jeep Renegade Mahindra XUV300 Mazda BT-50 Nissan Qashqai Suzuki Vitara Toyota C-HR VW Amarok 110kW Nissan NP200 Read: Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read 5 Things · 19m Ramaphosa sends a warning to one group of people, and another R870 million down the drain Finance · 2h Big win for the South African Reserve Bank Business Opinion · 16h Dawie Roodt warns of the one weapon the United States can still use against South Africa Business Opinion · 17h Good news for complexes and estates in South Africa Government · 19h New driving licence card coming to South Africa Government · 20h Biggest livestock farming disaster South Africa has ever experienced Industry News Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa Partner content Codehesion can build a world-class smartphone app for your business in 2026 Partner content Enhancing post-retirement income with discretionary solutions Partner content Standard Bank representative office first to be re-licensed under Ethiopia’s new banking proclamation Partner content Business Talk – Where South Africans go to learn about the latest trends Partner content BusinessTech sponsored articles – Unmatched reach and impact for key marketing More News Lifestyle · 21h Two weeks to disaster for one of South Africa’s richest towns Government · 21h Lifeline for crisis-hit businesses in South Africa Property · 22h Major new shopping mall opening in South Africa’s latest hotspot for the rich Business Opinion · 23h FNB has good news for South Africa Finance · 24h SARS sends a warning to these taxpayers in South Africa Business · 1d Outsurance listing on A2X Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

With approximately 34 people dying on South African roads each day, the government and law enforcement agencies are intensifying efforts to ensure compliance and safety across key routes in South Africa. According to officials, human error accounts for a staggering 80% of road fatalities, particularly during peak travel times, and this remains a significant concern heading into the holiday season. The Department of Transport (DoT) and provincial traffic authorities have confirmed that roadblocks will be significantly increased across major highways, provincial routes, and urban centres. These measures aim to curb dangerous driving behaviours such as speeding, drunk driving, and reckless overtaking, which are among the leading causes of crashes. Research shows that most accidents occur late at night, on weekends, and during the early morning hours—times when enforcement will be particularly stringent. In addition to addressing driver behaviour, authorities are cracking down on vehicle roadworthiness. Transport officials noted that approximately 10% of registered vehicles on South African roads are deemed unroadworthy, exacerbating the risks for all road users. With the average vehicle age sitting at 11 years, many cars suffer from poor maintenance, which heightens the likelihood of accidents. Vehicles found with serious defects will not be allowed to continue their journeys. Under this policy, any vehicle found with three or more critical defects during a roadblock will be immediately impounded. This includes vehicles with issues such as: Leaking engine oil, Defective lights, Faulty brakes, Worn tyres, Expired driving or car licences, and Cracked windscreens. Minister Barbara Creecy has urged motorists to take greater responsibility for ensuring their vehicles are safe for the road. Drivers are encouraged to have their cars inspected before embarking on long journeys, to carry all necessary documentation, and to adopt essential safety habits. These include adhering to speed limits, avoiding overtaking on barrier lines, and taking regular breaks every two hours to combat fatigue. Creecy stressed that drivers who fail to comply with traffic regulations or are caught engaging in unsafe behaviours will face severe consequences, including steep fines and jail time. Pedestrian safety is another focus area this festive season. Authorities have warned pedestrians to use designated crossings, wear bright or reflective clothing at night, and avoid walking near roads when under the influence of alcohol. Pedestrian fatalities remain a significant contributor to the overall road death toll, and officials are urging both drivers and pedestrians to be more vigilant and mindful of their surroundings. To ensure the effectiveness of these measures, traffic law enforcement agencies, including metro police departments and provincial traffic authorities, will operate on an expanded 24/7 shift system. This means a constant presence of officers at roadblocks, key intersections, and known accident hotspots, ensuring that dangerous drivers and unroadworthy vehicles are removed from the roads. By targeting both drivers and vehicle conditions, authorities aim to address the root causes of accidents and bring down the unacceptably high number of fatalities. The festive season is a time of celebration, but it has historically been marred by tragedy on the country’s roads. Motorists, passengers, and pedestrians alike are being urged to play their part in ensuring that roads are safer, lives are saved, and tragedies are avoided during this busy time.

Of the 11,883 fatalities recorded last year, a sobering 1,285 occurred during the festive season, a period notorious for a spike in accidents and road-related deaths. “These statistics are sobering,” said Creecy. “The number of road crashes and the impact on our people and our country is a tragic story of death and destruction, year in and year out. “Behind every statistic is a story – a life lost, a family left grieving, or often there is a person dealing with life-changing injuries,” she added. To curb this tragic trend, the Department is working closely with the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), along with provincial and municipal authorities, to implement targeted interventions aimed at ensuring safer travel this December. These efforts will focus on enforcement, education, and pedestrian safety, particularly on routes identified as the most dangerous based on accident data. The list of high-risk routes includes key national and provincial roads across the country: Limpopo: R71 Mankweng, R37 Mecklenburg and the N1 Naboomspruit Mpumalanga: R573 KwaMhlanga, N4 Vosman and N4 Nelspruit Gauteng: R21 Kempton Park North West: N12 Potchefstroom and N12 Klerksdorp KZN: N2 Pongola and N2 Umkomaas Eastern Cape: R61 Mzamba, N2 Libode, N2 Idutywa, R61 Umthatha, N2 Mount Ayliff, R61 Libode and N2 Umthatha Western Cape: N2 Khayelitsha To address the risks, Creecy confirmed that stringent monitoring would be in place on these routes, with traffic law enforcement working 24/7 to curb dangerous behaviours. Research indicates that most crashes occur late at night, over weekends, and during the early morning hours. As a result, authorities will focus on speeding violations, vehicle roadworthiness, and the critical issue of drunk driving. Offenders will face severe consequences, including jail time. Minister Creecy urged drivers to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy, carry valid documentation, and adhere to critical safety practices, such as taking breaks every two hours on long journeys, obeying speed limits, and avoiding overtaking on barrier lines. Pedestrians were also warned to use designated crossings, wear bright clothing at night, and stay off the roads when under the influence of alcohol. The emphasis on safety comes as South Africa ranks among the world’s most nerve-racking countries to drive. According to a survey by UK-based Scrap Car Comparison, South Africa is placed 21st out of the 25 scariest driving destinations, with a “scare score” of 6.8 out of 10. The ranking was based on responses from 2,000 international motorists who cited the dangerous driving of other road users as their primary concern. While India topped the list with a score of 7.15, South Africa’s position reflects ongoing concerns about road safety. With the festive season approaching, South Africans are urged to prioritise road safety. Simple measures such as buckling up, planning ahead, and avoiding reckless driving could mean the difference between life and death. By working together to prioritise safety, both motorists and pedestrians can help ensure that this holiday season is not marred by tragedy but remembered for joyous celebrations shared with loved ones.

Discovery Insure’s new Drive Trends research is an analysis of Discovery Insure Vitality Drive members’ driving behaviour data and covers the year-end holidays (from 1 December to 31 January) from 2021 to 2023. Notably, the data shows that speeding has a minimal impact on arriving at your destination faster and it also increases the likelihood of being in an accident. “Our report reveals a 26% increase in speeding over the holiday period, which we define as driving at least 10 km/h over the speed limit, as drivers take advantage of open roads and less traffic,” said Robert Attwell, Discovery Insure CEO. “During the December-January period, people are understandably eager to get to their holiday destinations as soon as possible. “However, compared to those who stick to the speed limit, we found that those who speed only saved two to four minutes per hour travelled, depending on traffic. We encourage drivers to rather enjoy the journey and take a relaxed, safe trip down to the coast to avoid risking you and your passengers’ safety.” The analysis also showed that the most common road trip over the festive season in South Africa is from Johannesburg to Durban, with over half of these trips taking place between 15 and 24 December. “Our data shows that the trip from Johannesburg to Durban takes around six hours and 30 minutes, including one rest stop, which takes an average of 37 minutes,” said Attwell. “Around 7% of drivers make the journey in one go, which gives only a marginal time-saving.” People who don’t have a rest stop drive 36% more aggressively in the second half of their trip than those who have rested. “Rather take a break so you are rested and alert, minimising your risk of unfocused driving that could lead to an accident. Taking a half-hour break doesn’t delay your trip much at all.” The report also shows that most people drive back to Joburg from Durban between the 2 nd and the 5 th of January. The trip takes about six hours and 21 minutes and includes an average rest stop of 34 minutes. Most people return from Durban on 2 January, making it the busiest day on the roads to drive back to Johannesburg. “If possible, delay your return trip by a few days. As we get closer to 7 January, our data shows there are half as many cars on the road as on 2 January,” said Atwell. “In the week after 7 January, there are historically only 10% as many cars as on the day after New Year’s Day. If you can work remotely or extend your stay to avoid the traffic, you can significantly reduce your accident risk and arrive home safe.” Source: Discovery Insure A later start in the morning is better Although many South Africans start their long-distance trips between 04:00 and 07:00, this may result in longer drivers. Discovery Insure said that a departure after 08:00 results in drivers dealing with less traffic, across all journeys measured. Nearly a third of all road trips start between 04:00 and 07:00. To beat the traffic, it may be better to consider a late start as only 9% of trips start between 07:00 and 08:00, and 12% start after 11:00.

Motorists still pay around R21 per litre for petrol in South Africa, despite the reprieve from the mid-year hikes and a minor increase for December. As of 4 December, despite a minor increase, fuel prices have decreased since the start of the year, with petrol prices dropping by 4.5%. Diesel, meanwhile, has decreased by a notable 6.8%. Kicking motorists, however, is increasing toll fees, which the Department of Transport updated in March 2024 – hiking tolls by 6.25%. How much it costs BusinessTech has calculated the costs of travelling to South Africa’s most popular holiday destinations using the country’s top-selling cars in five categories, including bakkie, SUV, hatchbacks, and crossover. The calculation takes into account the cost of petrol and the expected toll fee increases. South Africa’s best-selling cars in the selected categories were selected from the latest new vehicle sales report provided by Naamsa. We then calculated each car’s fuel consumption based on the manufacturer’s provided average per 100km. In each case, the manufacturer’s least expensive model—and for bakkies, the cheapest double cab—was considered. For comparison purposes, inland 95 octane (R21.47) and 0.005% diesel prices (R19.33) as of December were used. We then calculated the fuel costs when travelling to some of South Africa’s most popular destinations, using the City of Johannesburg/Tshwane as a benchmark. These costs were then added to the latest toll costs as of 1 March 2024. *Diesel cars.

The initiative forms part of the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy’s (DMRE) broader Cleaner Fuels Two (CF2) regulations, originally announced in 2021. These regulations mandate the use of diesel with a maximum sulfur content of 10ppm and impose stricter limits on harmful compounds in petrol. Similar standards have been adopted in developed nations, with the United States, European Union, New Zealand, and soon Australia, already limiting sulfur content in diesel to 10–15ppm. The move is driven by pressing environmental and health concerns. Diesel engines, while efficient, emit higher levels of nitrogen oxides and particulates compared to petrol engines. These pollutants pose significant risks to human health and contribute to air quality degradation. Sulfur in diesel compounds these issues, as it is converted to sulfur dioxide during combustion—a pollutant linked to respiratory problems and acid rain. Additionally, sulfur can form sulfuric acid, which accelerates corrosion in metal components. Reducing sulfur content to 10ppm significantly mitigates these effects, resulting in cleaner emissions and longer engine lifespans. Despite these advantages, South Africa lags behind global benchmarks. While ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuels have been the norm in many developed countries for over a decade, South Africa’s adoption of CF2 standards has faced numerous hurdles. The delay stems largely from the country’s refinery infrastructure, which is ill-equipped to produce 10ppm diesel on a large scale. At the time the CF2 regulations were introduced, only Sasol’s Secunda plant was capable of producing such diesel, leaving major refineries like Astron Energy, Enref, Natref, Sapref, and PetroSA requiring costly and complex upgrades. The Fuels Industry Association of South Africa (Fiasa) noted earlier this year that the initial timeline for implementing CF2 regulations—two years—was overly ambitious, given the operational challenges unique to South Africa. Acquiring and installing the necessary equipment for refinery upgrades is a lengthy process, compounded by regulatory hurdles and financial constraints. Additionally, the government needed more time to amend standards governing the sale of the older, higher-sulfur diesel grades, making a 2023 rollout unfeasible. Now targeting 2027, industry stakeholders are preparing for the shift. Sasol, a majority owner of the Natref refinery, is exploring investments to convert the facility into a hybrid plant capable of producing both crude and biofuels, aligning with the CF2 requirements. Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to revive and upgrade the PetroSA and Sapref refineries, the latter recently acquired for a symbolic one rand from Shell and BP. However, the extent of damage to Sapref, particularly following severe flooding in 2022, and the associated repair costs—estimated in the billions—raise concerns about whether the 2027 deadline is achievable. For motorists, the impact of the transition to ULSD is expected to be minimal, although 50ppm and 500ppm diesel are currently more widely available and less expensive. Most diesel engines manufactured since 2007 are compatible with 10ppm fuels, which are already available in South Africa for those who opt for premium-grade diesel. Additionally, the gradual implementation provides ample time for adaptation within the automotive and fuel industries. The shift is expected to reduce emissions significantly, contributing to better air quality and aligning South Africa with international environmental standards.

Following a long and challenging 2024, the patience of drivers are shorter and decisions may not be as well thought-out as they should be. This could result in needless mistakes, frustration and additional challenges for other weary drivers. The CEO of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, said that drivers need to avoid letting mental fatigue affect their driving in the lead-up to festive season closures. “The consequences of letting impatience and frustration blur decision-making will only add further difficulty to the end of your year,” said Herbert. “It may also result in starting your break with additional stressors if you are in a collision or affected by aggressive driving – provided there are not more serious injuries or even death.” “If you are feeling mentally fatigued, make a concerted effort to avoid falling victim to this to make it safely through the last few weeks of the working year.” Stay calm Drivers are more likely to make a mistake as the year nears its end. “Conversely, you are also likely to encounter even more drivers that purposefully drive with little thought for other road users. Irrespective of the cause, it is essential to not let this affect your own decisions on the road.” “Every time a driver cuts you off, breaks a law or simply makes a mistake, take a breath before reacting. Rather focus on avoiding their actions without endangering yourself or other drivers. Additionally, select music or podcasts before leaving to set you in the right frame of mind throughout a trip.” Avoid risks To avoid delays, many may also abandon defensive driving techniques. “No matter how short your patience is, defensive driving is the key to avoiding collisions. “Defensive driving is also what will help you remain calm by directing your attention to the obstacles other drivers create with their risky actions. It will also ensure you avoid becoming the driver that causes another to become frustrated or aggressive.” The festive season will also lead to more social gatherings and the drinking of alcohol. “Do not let the anticipation of the coming holiday period lower your inhibitions enough to drink and drive. Before leaving for an event, organise a safe way to get home and avoid the temptation that may arise after a few drinks.” Take a break One should avoid letting their mental fatigue take a back seat. “Avoid booking your end-of-year holiday directly after you finish work for the year. Take some time to relax and start your holiday travels refreshed.” Those who won’t enjoy an end-of-year break can consider options that will not mix mental fatigue and driving. “Use ride-share or public transport, keep your driving to a minimum, start or end trips earlier or later to avoid congestion, set virtual meetings, carpool or choose from many other options.

On 28 November 2024, CHARGE (formerly Zero Carbon Charge) launched the first renewable energy-powered EV charging station in South Africa. It relies almost entirely on solar and battery power. This will form part of the country’s first national network of 120 solar-powered charging facilities that CHARGE will be rolling out on major highways at 150km intervals over the coming year. “We are thrilled to be officially opening our first off-grid charging station, which marks a significant milestone in South Africa’s transition to EVs and a carbon-free future,” said Joubert Roux, Executive Chairman of CHARGE. “This has been a three-year journey, highlighting our commitment to making our off-grid network a reality as we believe it will benefit South Africans in multiple ways,” he added. The Wolmaransstad off-grid EV station offers six DC fast chargers (25-minute charge) and two AC chargers with a farm stall. CHARGE officials, Deputy Minister of Electricity Samantha Graham-Maré, North West MEC for Economic Development, Environment Conservation and Tourism, Bitsa Lenkopane and Maquassi Hills Local Municipality Mayor Mzwandile Feliti at the launch. Commenting on the event, Deputy Minister of Electricity Samantha Graham-Maré said that “we are actively driving renewable energy investments in South Africa, and I am truly inspired to see the determination and passion that the CHARGE team has displayed in driving this incredible development.” “The project is also aligned with the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan, which will be launched early next year. “The plan’s focus is on renewables driving local manufacturing, which will support projects such as CHARGE’s where off-grid EV charging stations will be developed at scale,” said Graham-Maré. “We are grateful for the immense support shown by the North West Provincial Government and the Maquassi Hills Municipality [as] they were the first government entities in the country to grant approval for the construction of our off-grid charging stations”, said Roux. Other provinces are following suit with MOUs recently signed with the provincial governments of Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape. R9.4 billion boost for electric vehicles in South Africa The Wolmaransstad charging facility, along with the entire network of 120 charging stations, will create an income stream for landowners on which these facilities are built. Landowners will earn 5% of the revenue generated from vehicles charging on their land. Roux said that the company believes that the rollout of the off-grid charging stations across the country will serve as a catalyst for EV migration in South Africa. “CHARGE’s own research shows that an EV charged from Eskom’s predominantly coal-fired power grid indirectly emits 5.8 tonnes of CO2 per year,” said Roux. “In comparison, an average petrol-powered car emits 4.4 tonnes of CO2 per year,” he added. This has been done with CHARGE’s Chinese technology partners, Greencore Energy Solutions and Magic Power, who have provided the charging hardware for the Wolmaransstad charging station, They will also be supplying the hardware for the other charging stations we will be rolling out across the country. “As we plan the rollout of more EV charging stations across the country, we will continue to work closely with government and key partners to help South Africa meet its carbon emissions reduction targets,” said Roux.

The highly popular Nissan NP200 bakkie, a staple on South African roads and a favourite for businesses and communities alike, was officially discontinued this year. The NP200, celebrated for its affordability and versatility, has long been one of South Africa’s top-selling vehicles. It consistently ranked high on sales charts and enjoyed popularity not just domestically but across Africa. This small light commercial vehicle (LCV) was a lifeline for small businesses and individuals needing a reliable and cost-effective workhorse. In its final month of production in March 2024, the bakkie achieved an astonishing 2,679 sales; a figure that underscored its enduring appeal and the rush to own one before it disappeared from dealership floors. Priced from just R245,300, the NP200 was a go-to choice for those seeking value, cementing its place as one of the country’s most affordable and functional vehicles. However, its discontinuation marks the end of an era and possibly the beginning of heightened risks for its owners. Experts warn that the NP200, along with other discontinued models such as the Nissan Almera and Toyota Etios, is likely to move up on the list of hijacker targets with longstanding favourites like the Toyota Hilux, Toyota Fortuner, and Volkswagen Polo. The vehicles Targeted are not just popular on South Africa’s roads; they are also highly sought after in the black market for spare parts. The link between hijackings and the availability of vehicle parts is starkly clear in South Africa. According to the South African Police Services (SAPS), the country sees an average of 66 car hijackings daily, a staggering 34% increase from pre-pandemic levels. Fidelity ADT has described the hijacking business as one driven by the principles of supply and demand. While some vehicles are stolen to be resold, the dismantling and resale of components have become a faster and more profitable alternative. The scarcity of spare parts for discontinued models like the NP200 exacerbates this issue, as thieves aim to meet the market’s needs. Nissan NP200 Cartrack, a leading car-tracking service, echoes these concerns, emphasising the rise in thefts of specific car components. Items such as wheels, tyres, tailgates, batteries, and airbags are among the most stolen, as they can be removed in mere minutes and are difficult to trace. This has made dismantled car parts a lucrative black-market trade, with illegal chop shops thriving on the high demand for affordable spares. Cartrack estimates the annual value of this illicit trade at R442 million, underscoring the scale of the problem. The discontinuation of the NP200 only heightens the risks. With production halted spare parts will inevitably become harder to find through legitimate channels. This scarcity is expected to fuel demand on the black market, further incentivising hijackers to target these vehicles. As a result, NP200 owners may find themselves more vulnerable to crime, especially in areas already identified as hijacking hotspots. Data from Tracker, another vehicle recovery service, shows that home driveways, malls, school events, and sports gatherings remain prime locations for vehicle theft. South Africa’s vehicle theft landscape is shaped by well-organised criminal syndicates capable of dismantling cars in minutes. The stolen parts are quickly absorbed into a thriving underground economy driven by businesses and individuals who cannot afford to buy new spares. As parts become scarcer, the NP200 bakkie’s affordability and widespread use will continue to make it a desirable target.

This initiative forms part of a collaboration between Visa and FNB, which completed the roll-out of new contactless (tap and go) payment stations across select toll gates ahead of the festive rush. This should ensure a more convenient and secure experience for South African motorists. Motorists at select toll plazas along the N3, TRAC N4 and Chapman’s Peak toll roads will be able to use several payment methods for contactless payments. Over 88 lanes have the new system along the N3 toll route between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal at De Hoek, Wilge, Tugela, Mooi River plazas and the on and off ramps. 73 lanes have the tap payment terminals installed along the N4 toll route between Pretoria and Mozambique at Diamond Hill, Middelburg, Machado, and Nkomazi plazas as well as the on and off ramps. FNB said that the new system will enhance security, reduce the possibility of fraud and allows users to keep cards or payment devices on their person during payment. “The new payment processing platform marks a key milestone that opens up possibilities for further payment processing innovation at toll plazas across the country,” said Daniel Kaan, CEO of Core Banking and Merchant Services at FNB. “The process involved close collaboration with concessionaires to ensure a fit-for-purpose system for motorists, and we’re pleased to see the excitement which has greeted the initial rollout. Feedback from the solution’s introduction has been highly positive.” “The solution has proven its benefits for not only toll concessionaires but issuers, acquirers, and cardholders.” Motorists at the Tap and go-enabled toll plazas will be able to use a variety of payment methods, such as Tap-enabled debit or credit cards (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) Payment apps like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay Wearables such as Garmin, Fitbit, Samsung, Apple, and others Other tap-enabled apps that allow the use of South African-issued bank cards The new tap payment terminals across South Africa’s tolls Foreign cards will now also be accepted at SA Toll plazas. If one does not have a contactless card or device, they can still pay with cash or use a SANRAL tag. That said, magstripe cards, that require the card to be physically swiped, will no longer be accepted at these toll plazas from 01 December 2024. Although magstripe payments will be phased out in favour of contactless payment methods, SANRAL and various toll concessionaires will continue accepting magstripe payments only until 31 May 2025 Fleet and garage magstripe cards will still be used until 30 June 2026. “Contactless payments are the natural evolution of the payments space. We welcome SANRAL and the toll concessionaires’ decision to encourage their adoption,’ said Kaan. “Contactless payments have proven to be popular amongst consumers as a quick, secure, and convenient way to pay. This is demonstrated in the growing popularity of contactless payments generally – more than 50% of card payments made by FNB customers are now contactless.” FNB’s rollout of the contactless system will expand to additional toll road concessionaires in 2025.

Transport Minister Barbara Creecy published a government gazette announcing that vehicles owned by the Gauteng Provincial Administrative (G-Fleet) can use the new number plate. The new aluminium number plates will require a South Bureau of Standards certification mark on the bottom right below the Gauteng province’s licence mark. It must also display the South African flag in the top left corner. Notably, the number plate must bear a 1cm by 1cm security feature (a barcode) positioned immediately below the United Nations’ country sign, “ZA.” A decal must also be attached below the security feature that will “self-destruct” if any attempt is made to remove it. The decal will have at least nine numbers and letters identifying the car that depicts the year of the expiry of the number plate. The new number plates are set to look incredibly similar to the Red Government Vehicle National Number plate seen below: Source: Government Gazette The latest news follows a series of promises from government officials. In February 2024, Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi announced the introduction of upgraded license plates, with Gauteng residents needing to apply for a new number plate. The new license plates were initially set to launch in April but missed their deadline. After stating that the new plates would be available to all motorists in Gauteng, Lesufi changed his tune and revealed that the pilot would start with government vehicles and then head to private vehicles. A key reason for the change is that Gauteng’s number plates are easy to clone and that criminals can use fake plates. Another reason for the shift in number plates is that the province’s car registration plates are running out of numeric and alphabetic combinations. The Gauteng Department of Transport did, however, previously tell our sister publication TopAuto that the current series of number plates (AA 11 AA GP) would remain in use until they were fully exhausted, which is expected to last until around 2038. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) previously expressed concerns over the new system, stating the new vehicle license plate scheme may come at a cost. Replacing the plates, as well as new controls and registration requirements, could increase costs for individuals and businesses, especially those with large fleets. Outa said this could lead to the scheme causing big fleet operations to license their vehicles in other provinces across the country. Outa stressed that these costs might tempt fleet operators to register vehicles outside of Gauteng to avoid the higher expenses, resulting in significant revenue losses for the province.

These crimes often occur when vehicles are stationary at red lights or in heavy traffic, making distracted or unprepared drivers easy targets. Johannesburg has seen a significant uptick in such incidents, especially along Grayston Drive in Sandton. A notable example was seen following road closures and increased traffic due to events like the recent Red Bull F1 Showrun in September, where opportunistic criminals targeted motorists in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Xolani Fihla emphasised the reality of these crimes and the steps being taken to mitigate them. Officers are conducting both visible and undercover patrols in areas of concern, but the onus remains on drivers to stay alert. To reduce the risk, motorists are advised to keep their doors locked and windows rolled up, even during brief stops. Valuables should be stored out of sight, as items like cell phones, handbags, and shopping bags are frequent targets. Distractions such as using phones or eating should also be avoided, as they can make drivers less aware of their surroundings. The City of Johannesburg has echoed these warnings, emphasising vigilance as a critical defence against these crimes. In Cape Town, a similar pattern has emerged. Between April and September 2024, the City recorded a steady rise in smash-and-grab incidents, with reports climbing from seven in April to 42 in September. Hotspots in the metro include intersections along Jakes Gerwel Drive, a major route connecting areas such as Mitchells Plain and Acacia Park. Alderman JP Smith, the City’s mayoral committee member for Safety and Security, highlighted motorists’ vulnerability at intersections, especially when distracted by their phones or personal belongings. A smash-and-grab incident caught on camera in Klipriver, Johannesburg. As the festive season approaches, there is concern that criminal activity may increase further. Limited resources make it challenging to maintain a constant law enforcement presence at all hotspots, and while patrols and surveillance cameras provide some deterrence, prevention ultimately begins with the driver. Smith urged road users to secure their valuables in their vehicle’s boot, remain vigilant, and be mindful of their surroundings, particularly in known high-risk areas. Beyond city-level efforts, organisations like Tracker have also issued warnings. The holiday season, especially around Black Friday and Christmas, presents an opportune time for criminals. Shoppers eager to secure deals may leave their purchases visible on car seats, turning their vehicles into prime targets. While law enforcement and community awareness initiatives are in place, the unpredictable nature of these opportunistic crimes underscores the importance of individual vigilance. Smash-and-grab incidents typically involve perpetrators breaking vehicle windows to snatch valuables quickly before fleeing. These differ from “theft out of motor vehicles,” which often involve items taken from open windows or unsecured vehicle storage areas. Both types of crime exploit moments of inattention, making alertness the first line of defence. Metro officers in Cape Town recently conducted awareness drives along major routes like the N2 and Jakes Gerwel Drive. Surveillance technology is also being used to detect suspicious behaviour and alert authorities, though criminals frequently disappear before officers arrive. However, the reality remains that no system is foolproof. As South African roads become busier during the holiday season, the risk of falling victim to smash-and-grab crimes increases. Motorists across the country are reminded to take simple but effective precautions: lock your doors, avoid displaying valuables, and stay attentive, especially in traffic or at intersections. With proactive behaviour and heightened awareness, drivers can significantly reduce their vulnerability and ensure a safer journey during this bustling time of year.

This was revealed at the recent KwaZulu-Natal Investment Conference, where a memorandum of understanding between CHARGE and the provincial Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA) in support of this project was also signed. The rollout will include a truck charging and battery swapping route on the major freight N3 highway between Durban and Johannesburg as well as the development of 17 solar-powered electric passenger vehicle charging stations. The municipalities where the charging stations will be located are: Alfred Duma Local Municipality uMuziwabantu Local Municipality Umkhanyakude District Municipality Okhahlamba Local Municipality Abaqulusi Municipality Greater Kokstad Local Municipality Inkosi Langalibalele Local Municipality uMngeni Local Municipality Mkhambathini Local Municipality Umuziwanbantu Municipality Greater Kokstad Local Municipality uPhongolo Local Municipality UMlalazi Local Municipality Broadly, the MOU outlines that the EDTEA has made a commitment to creating a conducive environment for the rollout of off-grid EV charging stations in KwaZulu-Natal. In particular, it includes the development of the first off-grid, ultra-fast electric truck charging and battery swapping stations. The partnership with EDTEA aims to develop a network of off-grid EV charging stations across KwaZulu-Natal’s agricultural regions, where farmers can benefit by receiving up to 5% of the revenue generated from charging stations on their land, along with access to surplus electricity. CHARGE said that these charging stations form part of the 120 renewable EV charging facilities that it is developing across the country, spaced at 150km intervals. An additional 120 electric truck charging stations will also be developed on major highways across South Africa. Massive R1 billion boost for electric vehicles in South Africa The EDTEA and the Trade and Investment Agency of KwaZulu-Natal (TIKZN) has said that they will act as a “one-stop shop” for the development of the CHARGE network in the province. This will include a focus on reducing the regulatory red tape currently hampering the approval processes for the building of the charging stations. Furthermore, the EDTEA and TIKZN will play a role in identifying and advising on additional future electric passenger vehicle charging sites as well as locations for the development of off-grid electric truck charging sites across the province. CHARGE Executive Chairman Joubert Roux signing the pledge. “We are grateful to the KwaZulu-Natal Government for their support and belief in our project,” said CHARGE executive chairman Joubert Roux. “This landmark agreement marks a significant step forward in KwaZulu-Natal’s transition to sustainable energy and transportation, preparing the province for the shift to EVs in South Africa,” he added. CHARGE’s off-grid charging stations will operate uninterrupted in the event of grid power interuptions and “will provide a clean, zero-emission alternative to charging from Eskom’s primarily dirty coal-powered grid,” said the company. According to research commissioned by CHARGE, an EV charged from Eskom’s national power grid indirectly emits 5.8 tonnes of CO2 per year. By comparison, an average petrol-powered car emits 4.4 tonnes of CO2 per year. “This highlights that simply swapping petrol cars for grid-powered EVs won’t help reduce emissions,” said CHARGE.

MEC Musa Zondi said that “the launch of CHARGE’s green charging stations marks a transformative step in our journey towards a carbon-neutral economy.” “The MOU underscores our commitment to not only reducing our carbon footprint but also creating new economic opportunities and enhancing energy resilience in our communities. “We hope that KwaZulu-Natal can set a bold example for other provinces on how to achieve sustainable growth that benefits both our citizens and the planet,” added Zondi. This pledge comes on the back of numerous hefty solar EV charging investments made by the company. For example, in October 2024 CHARGE announced a R11.4 billion investment in the rollout of charging stations in the Eastern Cape, starting in the first quarter of 2025.

Vehicle emissions also contribute to global warming. Electric vehicles could help solve these problems but they’ve been slow to take off in the region . Its biggest economy, South Africa, had only about 1,000 electric vehicles by 2022 . We are specialist transport engineers whose research has focused on electric vehicles and road freight transport in sub-Saharan Africa. In our work we look at how electric vehicles could contribute to reducing emissions in the region, and what is standing in the way of electrifying transport. One of the reasons for low uptake is the high cost of electric vehicles. They also have limited range and their batteries are slow to charge: a problem for long distance or frequent driving. The inability of countries to generate and distribute enough clean electricity is also a barrier to electrifying vehicles. Just over half of all electricity in the region comes from burning fossil fuels . Powering electric vehicles with electricity generated by burning fossil fuels wouldn’t necessarily reduce carbon emissions. However, the rollout of electric motorcycles and small public transport vehicles has already begun. If all vehicles could be made locally, using clean energy, there would be tremendous economic benefits for the region. Electric mobility is some way off Transitioning to electric mobility requires clean energy provision, which means investing in electricity infrastructure. Electric vehicle charging stations can be installed fast: South Africa already has a very high electric vehicle ratio of one charger for every five cars , compared to the UK at 1:20 . But these charging stations must be able to deliver electricity when vehicles need it. They need reliable, renewable energy stored in large battery systems to do so – and these large battery systems are still being developed . In sub-Saharan Africa informal public transport moves about 72% of the region’s passengers . Freight moves goods in the absence of adequate rail. Electrifying these sectors needs careful planning . Informal “paratransit” or “popular transportation” is made up of minibuses (matatu, ndiaga ndiaye, danfo, trotro), three-wheelers (tuk-tuk) and motorbikes (boda boda, moto). Planning for the eventual electrification of informal taxis is complicated by the sector’s unscheduled , decentralised , often chaotic and demand-driven nature . Freight transport is a leading indicator for economic growth, and for economies to grow, freight transport must grow. This means that national and local governments must plan and invest in high powered, fast charging stations along transport routes. These must be able to charge different sizes and kinds of trucks. The freight industry cannot absorb these costs alone. Need for rapid change The transport sector must make the transition to electric mobility faster than the breakneck speed at which smartphones were adopted if it is to meet Net Zero – an end to carbon emissions – by 2050. Costly electrical and civil infrastructure ( roads, minibus termini, truck stops, electricity distribution networks ) will be needed – and soon. However, our results show that fleets will have to contain a mix of electric and combustion-based engines if countries want to continue to transport the same amount of goods and people they are currently transporting. This is because electric vehicles charge slowly. While a diesel minibus taxi takes only one minute to fill up with enough diesel to travel 750 kilometres, the fastest currently available electric minibus recharges at a mere 2km per minute with DC and 0.3km per minute with AC. The electric taxi’s range is also only 21% of the diesel equivalent. Filling stations in the region generally store the equivalent of up to 225,000km worth of fuel for a diesel minibus. The same size of stationary electric battery storage will store a mere 16,000km for an electric equivalent minibus. Range-extending and potentially swappable battery storage can be used (where a trailer acts as a mobile battery bank to the vehicle, and is charged from a solar charging station to reduce emissions). But this will increase the cost so much that it may not be financially viable for the freight industry at all. Building a local electric vehicle industry Except for South Africa, the region has been a dumping ground for second hand vehicles from developed countries . The comparatively simple designs of electric vehicles provide an opportunity for sub-Saharan Africa to move away from accepting second hand vehicles and towards a new local electric vehicle industry . Workers in hundreds of thousands of jobs making combustion engines could be reskilled to make electric vehicles. Africa already has the skills to design and produce the powertrain components, such as batteries and electric motors . Setting up local industries would also spare sub-Saharan Africa from being flooded by cheap electric vehicle imports that don’t contribute to local employment. Ethiopia has recently banned the import of combustion vehicles . Africa’s first all-electric mass rapid transit was set up in Dakar, Senegal in 2023. The Golden Arrow bus company in South Africa purchased 120 electric buses this year. Heavy haul electric trucks are also entering the South African market space. Africa has already produced tens of thousands of electric two- and three-wheelers used for public transport and last-mile delivery. These include Ampersand in Rwanda , Roam Electric in Kenya, and Spiro in Benin . Batteries are usually provided through swapping and payment by mobile phone. In South Africa, Mellowvans produce a last-mile three-wheeler. A Roam Air electric motorbike recently completed the 6000km journey from Nairobi to Stellenbosch using only the region’s abundant solar power. In Kenya, BasiGO assembled buses locally and now provides finance for electric buses. Roam Electric makes locally designed electric buses (and motorbikes). Meanwhile, a project owned by the South African National Energy Development Institute at Stellenbosch University in South Africa has converted a petrol minibus taxi and a 65-seater diesel bus to electric. Electrification is inevitable The shift to electric vehicles is inevitable. These steps are needed first: Review transport policy related to freight vehicles, such as axle weight and vehicle length, to ensure that imported electric vehicles can operate on African road networks. Ensure paratransit is safe, efficient and equitable . Carefully consider import duties and incentives. Rwanda scrapped customs tax on electric vehicles to make them cheaper, but this led to an influx of old hybrid vehicles with depleted batteries. South Africa has vehicle import duties to protect local production, but an additional luxury tax on electric vehicles makes these expensive to buy. Rethink the taxation model . In South Africa, for example, fuel levies make up a chunk of national revenue . To make the most of the electric mobility revolution, sub-Saharan African countries need policies and incentives to localise production and invest in green energy , lest they miss the bus.

According to TopAuto , Recent filings with South Africa’s Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) reveal at least eight new nameplates that have never been officially sold in the country, alongside several others registered in prior years. The trademarks include a mix of luxury vehicles, electric models, SUVs, bakkies, and sedans. Among these are the Alphard and Vellfire, luxury MPVs known for their opulent interiors, and the Highlander and Kluger, both mid-size SUVs that enjoy popularity in international markets. Other entries like the Sequoia and Tundra represent full-size offerings—a massive SUV and bakkie, respectively—while the Tacoma is a mid-size bakkie aimed at outdoor and adventure enthusiasts. The electric vehicle (EV) segment is also represented by the bZ3C, an electric crossover coupe, and the bZ3X, a conventional electric crossover. These models align with Toyota’s global push towards electrification under the “bZ” (beyond Zero) branding, aimed at reducing emissions and embracing alternative energy solutions. Despite the excitement these trademarks have generated, Toyota South Africa has refrained from confirming any plans to introduce these models to the local market. The company stated that it does not comment on future product strategies, leaving enthusiasts to speculate about the likelihood of these vehicles appearing on South African roads. It’s important to note that trademark filings do not guarantee a vehicle’s launch in a particular region. This approach often serves as a protective measure for intellectual property, ensuring that the names remain available for potential use. Toyota has followed a similar strategy in markets like Australia, where it clarified that trademark registrations do not necessarily indicate upcoming product launches. Following the trail of trademarks The new trademarks applied for by TMC, as listed on the CIPC database, are detailed in the below table: Model Segment Trademark Alphard Luxury MPV Applied on 31 October 2024 bZ3C Electric crossover coupe Accepted on 9 May 2024, registered on 13 November 2024 bZ3X Electric crossover Accepted on 16 November 2023, registered on 13 May 2024 Highlander Mid-size SUV Applied on 31 October 2024 Kluger Mid-size SUV Applied on 12 November 2024 Proace Mid-size panel van/MPV Accepted on 19 March 2020, registered on 19 April 2024 Sequoia Full-size SUV Applied on 1 November 2024 Tacoma Mid-size bakkie Applied on 1 November 2024 Tundra Full-size bakkie Applied on 6 November 2024 Vellfire Luxury MPV Applied on 6 November 2024 Vista Mid-size sedan Applied on 6 November 2024 Toyota Sequoia For South Africa, additional factors complicate the introduction of these vehicles. Many of the trademarked models are currently produced only in left-hand drive configurations, catering to specific markets such as North America, Japan, or Europe. Converting these vehicles to right-hand drive, as required in South Africa, would entail significant investment, a decision that Toyota might weigh against the relatively small size of the local market. Another hurdle is the quality of local fuel, which has previously been cited as a challenge for introducing certain advanced powertrains to South Africa. The country’s infrastructure and market conditions may not yet fully support some of the sophisticated technologies and fuel requirements associated with these vehicles. While the trademarks for models like the Alphard, bZ3C, Tacoma, and others hint at exciting possibilities, their arrival in South Africa remains uncertain.

From December 1, 2024, swipe payments at all N4 toll gates will no longer be accepted. This change, announced by Trans African Concessions (Trac), the firm managing the N4 route, is part of an effort to modernise payment systems and enhance security for motorists. The N4 highway is a critical link, stretching from the Solomon Mahlangu off-ramp in Tshwane, Gauteng, to the Port of Maputo in Mozambique. For countless holidaymakers, this route represents a gateway to their year-end destinations. With the termination of magstripe card payments , Trac is urging drivers to plan ahead and familiarise themselves with alternative payment options. Motorists can use contactless-enabled debit or credit cards. These cards rely on EMV (Europay, Visa, and Mastercard) chip technology, which supports secure transactions through “tap and pay” functionality. In addition, smart devices like smartphones and smartwatches linked to payment apps such as Apple Pay or Samsung Pay will also be accepted. Trac tags, which provide a convenient, automated toll payment solution, remain a reliable option for frequent travellers. Cash payments will continue to be accepted for those who prefer traditional methods. The decision to phase out swipe payments stems from a need to keep pace with advancements in financial technology and improve transaction security at toll gates. Magnetic stripe cards have become increasingly susceptible to fraud, and their gradual replacement with contactless and chip-based systems reflects a global shift toward safer and more efficient payment methods. By embracing these modern alternatives, Trac aims to ensure smoother operations and shorter queues at toll plazas, enhancing the overall travel experience for road users. As the festive season approaches, Trac’s announcement is a timely reminder for holiday travelers to update their payment methods before hitting the road. Whether it’s through a contactless card, the ease of a smart device, or a Trac tag, ensuring preparedness will help motorists avoid disruptions and focus on enjoying their journey along the N4. This update enhances payment security and supports a smoother experience at tolls.

The group’s latest data for October 2024 shows that Chinese car brand, Great Wall Motors (GWM) is outselling 18 different brands in South Africa, many of which have been on the market for far longer. GWM owns five brands—Haval, WEY, ORA, TANK and GWM Pickup—with Haval in particular gaining traction in South Africa. GWM is now a consistent top 10 best-selling brand in South Africa alongside another Chinese carmaker, Chery. These were the top-selling brands in South Africa in October, according to Naamsa. Toyota – 11,891 units VW – 6,340 units Suzuki – 6,006 units Ford – 2,965 units Hyundai – 2,913 units Isuzu – 2,251 units Chery – 1,831 units GWM – 1,796 units Renault – 1,734 units Kia – 1,508 units Mahindra – 1,421 units Nissan – 1,304 units BMW – 1,007 units Omoda & Jaecoo – 605 units Mercedes-Benz – 474 units Stellantis – 402 units Mazda – 239 units BAIC – 227 units Honda – 217 units JAC – 193 units Mitsubishi – 192 units Porsche – 104 units Jaguar Land Rover – 82 units Subaru – 65 units Proton – 54 units Volvo – 47 units While Chinese car brand climb the rankings, more premium brands are dropping off. Data shows that longer-term views show that big brands like Merc and BMW have dropped off the top 10 in South Africa completely. In October, BMW ranked 13th, and Merc ranked 15th. Standard Bank has noted a similar trend, in that finance arrangements for Chinese cars have consistently increased since 2022 despite an overall depression in new-car sales. “Even though Chinese brands currently represent less than 10% of our retail sales, their upward trajectory is remarkable given the challenging market conditions,” said Derick De Vries, Head of Automotive Retail at Standard Bank Vehicle and Asset Finance. “These brands are clearly gaining significant traction, reflecting the broader global trend where Chinese vehicles are taking more market share, driven by competitive pricing and growing consumer confidence.” And the trend is set to continue. According to one of South Africa’s largest automotive companies, Combined Motor Holdings (CMH)—a primary distributor of Haval, Suzuki and Chery—vehicle imports from India and China already make up 50% of all vehicles the company imports. It expects that over 25% of the new car markets to be taken up by Chinese brands in 2025. The primary driver behind the rise of Chinese vehicles in South Africa is that they are more affordable. This is a crucial consideration when understood in the context that the vehicle prices in South Africa have far outstripped inflation over the past 30 years, making the chances of being able to afford a ‘premium’ vehicle in 2024 an unattainable luxury to most. Analysis by BusinessTech showed that a middle market vehicle in South Africa is now R150,000 more than it was in 1994 , when adjusted for inflation – reflecting a nearly 750% increase in pricing over the decades. Even over the last 10 years , the price of a Mercedes-Benz has increased by 131% – while salaries have barely kept up with inflation, meaning these premium vehicles are more unaffordable than ever. Analysis from Lightstone Auto earlier in the year noted that as affordable cars become more feature-rich and safe as a baseline, the appeal of premium vehicles—outside their prestige—loses its lustre. The group added that consumers have clearly been forced to adapt to the changing economic landscape in the country over the past few years, which has kept vehicle sales down. Many have responded to this by pricing down when buying vehicles. While 2024 represents the start of a potential turning point here—with interest rates easing and disposable income showing a positive turn—data from Old Mutual shows that a significant portion of households (12%) are still pricing down in vehicles. On top of this—a broad negative for the new vehicle market overall—is that households are also choosing to keep and maintain their big purchases for longer, instead of buying new, or even second hand.

As a result, many individuals are now burdened with cars that are unusable, yet still obligated to make monthly payments. NCC spokesperson Phetho Ntaba told Newzroom Afrika that disgruntled consumers are increasingly approaching it for assistance after being sold (particularly second-hand) cars by dealerships with defects. She said that the NCC is now averaging between 250 and 300 complaints per month regarding second-hand motor vehicles. “Consumers say they bought these vehicles, they were not given information about the car or history of the car [and] they experience defects within a short period of time – be it a month, a day or three days … the shortest period of time,” said Ntaba. Ntaba noted that there is a noticeable trend among disgruntled consumers. For example, when the consumer communicates with the supplier, the supplier either repairs the vehicles but fails to meet the consumer’s expectations, or they outright refuse to provide repairs or refunds. She said that this often happens even after intervention from the Motor Industry Ombudsman. In some cases, dealerships claim the issues with the vehicles were caused by the drivers’ behavior, despite some findings where odometers have been tampered with and the mileage turned back (as just one example). In other instances, they argue that car buyers signed agreements accepting responsibility for any defects that arise once the vehicle leaves the dealership. The consumer tribunal has recently ruled on cases where they said that these arguments not only violate the rights of consumers as enshrined in the Consumer Protection Act but also bring the entire industry into disrepute. The act provides that every consumer has a right to receive goods that are reasonably suitable for the purpose for which they are generally intended, of good quality and must be usable and durable for a reasonable period of time. Section 56(2)(a) requires that “within six months after delivery of any goods to the consumer, the consumer may return the goods to the supplier without penalty and the supplier must, at the direction of the consumer repair or replace the unsafe or defective goods.” Ntaba said that some dealerships are often aware of consumers’ legal rights and frequently use written contracts to protect themselves in the event that defects are discovered in the vehicles after purchase. What to do To address this issue, Ntaba stated that the NCC plans to launch initiatives aimed at educating dealerships on the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. For consumers, Ntaba recommends that before purchasing any vehicle, consumers should take the time to thoroughly research the car extensively. “If you buy a car, inspect it. We have seen people buying cars online and that is something else, completely different. Inspect the vehicle, you are protected by the law. They cannot force you to buy a car that you are not comfortable with,” she said. Consumers should also avoid feeling pressured or rushed into making a decision. “Test drive the car. Get someone who is going to assist you to evaluate the car and ask those questions. “We rely heavily on them and when they do not give you the correct information, do approach the NCC” and the Ombudsman, said Ntaba. The spokesperson added that under current law, there needs to be a completed transaction, and something has to go wrong either during or after the transaction for action to be taken. However, nothing prevents consumers from seeking additional services to protect themselves, though they may have to pay for these services. “It’s always better to take some extra time to fully understand the product you’re purchasing rather than facing problems later on. “Addressing those issues can take time, and it may be a lengthy process before consumers can get the redress they seek,” she added.

Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen have voiced increasing concerns about South Africa’s sluggish transition to new energy vehicles (NEVs) amid a global shift toward electric vehicles (EVs). With over 110,000 direct employees and around 500,000 people engaged within the broader automotive value chain, the industry is a crucial part of South Africa’s economy. However, as the international market progressively adopts EVs, the country risks falling behind. The slow adoption rate could severely affect the automotive industry’s relevance, especially as major markets like the European Union move toward stricter environmental regulations and transition deadlines. A significant shift in global regulations, notably the European Union’s planned ban on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2035, has accelerated the demand for innovation and new energy vehicles. Yet, South African manufacturers remain reluctant to invest in or produce EVs at scale. Analysts warn that this hesitation mirrors past industry failures, likening it to cases such as Kodak and Nokia, companies once dominant but ultimately overtaken by competitors because they failed to adapt quickly to technological advancements. Without proactive measures, South Africa’s automotive industry could see its share in major export markets dwindle, ultimately impacting the sector’s long-term sustainability. Recent data from Naamsa underscores these concerns. Domestic vehicle sales for October 2024 showed a modest increase, with 47,942 units sold—up by 2,506 units or 5.5% from October 2023’s 45,418 vehicles. Yet, the data paints a different picture when it comes to exports. Export sales dropped sharply, with only 23,342 units shipped in October 2024, a decrease of 17,324 vehicles or 42.6% from the 40,666 vehicles exported in the same month the previous year. Cumulatively, for the first ten months of the year, South Africa’s vehicle exports are now 23.1% lower than the corresponding period in 2023, a substantial decline that hints at deeper challenges. Mikel Mabasa, Naamsa’s CEO, points to several key factors behind this export slump. South Africa’s primary export market for vehicles, the European Union, has ramped up emissions regulations, putting pressure on ICE vehicle exports. Additionally, an influx of cheaper EV models from China is also reshaping the competitive landscape, particularly in Europe. Europe, which accounts for nearly 75% of South Africa’s vehicle exports, has seen sluggish economic growth, with projections indicating that Germany, one of South Africa’s key trading partners, is expected to end 2024 with a slight economic contraction of 0.2%. Such an environment increases the challenges South African exporters face, making it even more difficult to retain their foothold in the region without a robust transition to EV manufacturing. Mabasa remains cautiously optimistic, however, that easing monetary policies in key export markets could eventually help reinvigorate vehicle export growth. In the medium term, such economic shifts could encourage consumer spending, potentially creating a more favourable environment for South African vehicle exports. Nevertheless, the country’s automotive manufacturers will need to accelerate their adaptation to new energy vehicle production if they aim to capitalise on future demand shifts and retain competitiveness. The current export data clearly illustrates the consequences of lagging behind in the global EV transition, signaling that if South Africa’s automotive sector hopes to remain relevant, timely adaptation is essential.

Finding average car price data for 1994 proved to be difficult; however, using archived data from Bestsellingcarsblog.com, which lists the top-selling models of that time—such as the Toyota Corolla, VW CitiGolf, and Mazda 323—the average price of these popular vehicles was approximately R46,477 in 1994. When adjusted for inflation, this translates to around R242,852 in 2024 terms. Despite this, data from WesBank shows that the average new car price was R392,174 in the first quarter of 2024. This indicates a 744% increase in car prices since 1994, significantly surpassing the inflation-adjusted price by R149,322. However, the extent of these price hikes becomes even more pronounced when looking at specific models. For example, the Toyota Corolla, a top-selling vehicle in 1994, cost R51,039. In 2024, the price of a new Corolla starts at R536,500—a staggering 951% increase. This upward trend isn’t solely due to general economic factors; a poor Rand exchange rate has amplified these costs considerably. Over the years, the depreciation of the Rand against stronger global currencies has made imported vehicles and parts more expensive, directly impacting car prices in South Africa. The exchange rate has indeed been one of the key contributors to the country’s high car costs, but it isn’t the only factor. Manufacturers and industry analysts point to a combination of global supply chain disruptions, evolving safety standards, and consumer demands that necessitate additional features and technologies in modern vehicles. Cars today are equipped with advanced safety, entertainment, and emissions technology that often pushes production costs higher. These advancements are, of course, necessary and beneficial, but they also mean that car prices will generally rise above simple inflation adjustments. Beyond the exchange rate and global factors, local economic policies have also driven up vehicle costs. High import duties and taxes further increase the price of cars in South Africa. Unlike some countries that enjoy more favourable trade agreements or local manufacturing subsidies, South Africa faces additional financial burdens when importing vehicles. These costs trickle down to consumers, making the ownership of a new vehicle increasingly unaffordable for the average South African. A comparative study by Compare the Market Australia (CMA) underscores just how expensive cars have become in South Africa relative to other countries. This study looked at car prices in seven countries, including South Africa, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, and Peru, using models like the Ford Ranger, Toyota Hilux, and Honda Civic as benchmarks. South Africa was found to have the second-highest car prices among these countries, highlighting the financial strain faced by local consumers. The disparity between South Africa and other countries becomes even more apparent when factoring in after-tax income. CMA used data from the OECD Better Life Index to analyse the affordability of cars based on the average disposable income in each country. The findings revealed that South Africa has the least favourable car price-to-disposable income ratio, meaning South Africans would need more years of income to purchase a car than consumers in any of the other countries analysed. For instance, it would take an average South African 7.8 years of disposable income to buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee, over four years to afford a Honda Civic, and nearly three years for a Toyota Hilux. This ratio starkly contrasts with the USA, where a similar car could be purchased with only a fraction of the disposable income required in South Africa. These affordability challenges place South Africa at a disadvantage compared to countries like the USA, Canada, and New Zealand, which enjoy more favorable car price-to-income ratios. While Columbia ranks second after South Africa in terms of car affordability struggles, the gap remains significant. This issue not only limits the purchasing power of South African consumers but also impacts the broader economy, as high vehicle costs contribute to decreased mobility, fewer opportunities for car ownership, and increased dependency on public transport for many. The above-inflation cost increases of new cars in South Africa are a result of multiple intersecting factors, with the poor Rand exchange rate playing a central role. Coupled with global and local economic pressures, these factors have placed a considerable strain on South African consumers, leaving many with few affordable options.

Compiled by UK-based Scrap Car Comparison , this ranking was calculated from a “scare score” survey, where South Africa scored 6.8 out of 10. The study surveyed 2,000 motorists from diverse backgrounds, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Respondents were asked to rate how anxious they would feel about driving in 49 popular travel destinations, from “not nervous at all” to “extremely nervous.” Participants were also encouraged to share specific concerns about driving abroad, revealing insights into the unique stress factors associated with international driving. India topped the list with a scare score of 7.15, known for its chaotic roads where cars, motorbikes, rickshaws, and even livestock coexist. For foreign drivers, navigating India’s roads is not only a test of reflexes but also an immersion into the country’s distinct driving culture, where honking serves as a form of communication rather than just a warning. Rural roads in India are often underdeveloped, requiring extra caution, especially when passing through villages and agricultural areas. These conditions can make driving a daunting experience, especially for tourists unfamiliar with the traffic and road etiquette. Venezuela ranks second with a scare score of 6.97, where unpredictable road conditions and fuel shortages are common. Potholed roads pose significant risks, and fuel scarcity often results in long lines at gas stations, adding to travellers’ frustrations. Venezuelan traffic laws are also loosely enforced, leading to erratic driving behaviour and a lack of consistent lane discipline, creating a stressful experience for visitors unaccustomed to these hazards. In third place, Zimbabwe scored 6.90, where the rough condition of rural roads demands off-road vehicles for those venturing outside major cities. Fuel shortages are also frequent, and traffic checkpoints are common, where police are known to target tourists with demands for bribes. These challenges make navigating Zimbabwe’s roadways a daunting prospect for international drivers unfamiliar with the terrain and practices. Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum, New Zealand placed 25th, with a scare score of 5.77, while the Netherlands was noted as one of the least intimidating countries to drive in, scoring only 4.41. Known for its well-maintained infrastructure and clear road signage, the Netherlands offers foreign drivers a relatively stress-free experience. The extensive cycling culture also contributes to more organised and predictable traffic patterns, easing the anxiety for first-time visitors behind the wheel. The table below, as compiled by Scrap Car Comparison, details the top 25 most nerve-racking countries for tourists to drive in the world: Rank Country Scare score (out of 10) 1 India 7.15 2 Venezuela 6.97 3 Zimbabwe 6.90 4 Morocco 6.87 5 Thailand 6.86 6 China 6.84 7 Tunisia 6.79 8 Brazil 6.71 9 Colombia 6.71 10 Malaysia 6.70 11 Mexico 6.69 12 Turkey 6.68 13 Vietnam 6.67 14 Chile 6.52 15 Hungary 6.52 16 Argentina 6.48 17 Singapore 6.47 18 Ecuador 6.31 19 Japan 6.27 20 United Arab Emirates 6.12 21 South Africa 6.08 22 Hong Kong 5.97 23 Greece 5.86 24 Italy 5.83 25 New Zealand 5.77 The study highlighted that the most anxiety-inducing factor for travellers is driving on the opposite side of the road, with 56.2% of respondents naming this as their top concern. Close behind, 55.9% of tourists reported feeling nervous about the unpredictable driving behaviour of other road users. In third place, with 52.7%, was the fear of unknowingly breaking local traffic laws, adding an additional layer of worry for those navigating unfamiliar legal requirements. This global ranking underscores the challenges that come with driving in a foreign country, where local customs, road conditions, and enforcement of laws can vary greatly, often making the experience more stressful than expected. For those planning to drive in high-ranking countries like South Africa, Venezuela, or Zimbabwe, thorough preparation and awareness of local driving norms can be crucial in easing some of these anxieties. The top 10 reasons drivers are nervous about travelling the roads in other countries are summarised below: Rank Concern Average % of drivers stressed about this concern 1. Driving on the opposite side of the road 56.2% 2. Dangerous driving of other motorists on the road 55.9% 3. Accidentally breaking a road law 52.7% 4. Driving on unfamiliar roads 48.1% 5. Not understanding the road signs 43.1% 6. General safety e.g. car theft 33.3% 7. Being involved in a traffic collision and not being able to communicate in the local language 29.3% 8. Getting lost 28.6% 9. Getting pulled over and not being able to communicate in the local language 22.2% 10.

South Africa’s Minister of Sport, Arts, and Culture, Gayton McKenzie, recently announced that Kyalami is set to upgrade its facilities to reach FIA Grade 1 accreditation, the standard required for hosting a Formula 1 event. Kyalami holds a rich history with Formula 1, having hosted its first race in 1961. For generations, the circuit has been an emblem of high-speed racing, attracting fans from across South Africa and creating a lasting legacy in the world of motorsport. However, since the last South African Grand Prix was held in 1993, F1 enthusiasts in the country have been relegated to watching races on television, with no home race to attend. That might soon change as efforts intensify to bring Formula 1 back to South African soil. In September 2024, the prospect of a South African Grand Prix hit a milestone when Minister McKenzie met with Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. After the meeting, McKenzie shared his optimism, saying that South Africa is “one step closer to bringing it [Formula 1] back.” He also had a positive discussion with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, emphasising the international and local support for the initiative to bring Formula 1 back to Kyalami. To make this vision a reality, Kyalami has taken proactive steps by collaborating with Apex Circuit Design, a renowned motorsport engineering consultancy that has contributed to the development of some of the world’s top racetracks. Apex is working closely with Kyalami to create a roadmap that will lead to FIA Grade 1 accreditation, which involves rigorous safety, design, and facility upgrades to match the standards required by Formula 1. “Kyalami is perfectly suited to host top-tier international motor racing events,” said representatives from Kyalami. “With its extensive history in the sport and commitment to an engaging fan experience, Kyalami aims to be an ideal destination for Formula 1’s return to South Africa,” they said. Minister McKenzie expressed his appreciation for Toby Venter, the owner of Kyalami Circuit, thanking him for his dedication to the project and his investment in the nation’s motorsport aspirations. Venter’s initiatives, coupled with the expertise of the Apex team, have created a viable and realistic pathway to hosting Formula 1 once again. The race to bring Formula 1 back to South Africa is fueled by enthusiasm and diligent planning, with continuous negotiations underway with key stakeholders, including Liberty Media, the company that owns Formula 1. Although these discussions are ongoing, McKenzie’s update has injected a new wave of excitement among South African fans, who are eagerly awaiting the return of world-class motorsport to their homeland. In an X post (formally known as Twitter) on Thursday afternoon (31 October), McKenzie thanked the owners of Kayalami Race Track for investing in upgrading the track to F1 requirements and the APEX group for their expertise. “I love seeing a plan come together. F1 is coming home soon ,” said McKenzie. I wanna thank the owners of Kayalami race track for the investment to upgrade the track to F1 requirements. I wanna thank the APEX group for their expertise. Thank you to Premier @Lesufi 4 assisting greatly. I love seeing a plan getting together. F1 is coming home soon.

The South African economy and automotive industry provide key insights into why several well-known car brands have exited the country. South Africa’s automotive industry is a major economic sector, accounting for 4.3% of its GDP. In recent years, several global automakers have expanded their presence locally. BMW, for instance, committed to exclusively manufacturing the next-generation BMW X3 at its Rosslyn plant in Pretoria. Similarly, Ford made a significant investment of R15.8 billion in its local manufacturing operations, while Nissan allocated R3 billion to produce its new Navara model at its Pretoria plant. Toyota also invested R6.1 billion to boost production of its Hilux and Fortuner models in Durban, and Volkswagen earmarked R4.5 billion for new models and infrastructure at its Uitenhage facility. Beijing Automobile International Corporation (BAIC) also entered the market, investing R11 billion in a new vehicle manufacturing plant. These efforts have made brands like Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, and Ford dominant in South African car sales. According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa), Toyota led in sales in September 2024 with 10,890 vehicles, followed by Volkswagen with 5,885, Suzuki with 5,032, and Hyundai with 2,841. The Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, and Toyota Corolla Cross are among the most popular models. The strong consumer loyalty to established, locally manufactured brands poses a challenge for new international entrants. Combined with South Africa’s sluggish economic growth and complex business environment, it is clear why some international brands struggle to succeed. Brands such as Saab and Cadillac, which target wealthier buyers, have been unable to compete with established players like Toyota, BMW, and Ford, ultimately leading to their exit. Brands that remain, like Suzuki, Hyundai, Chery, and GWM, focus on offering affordable alternatives, which are increasingly becoming the most attractive model for South African motorists. Chinese manufacturers have exploded in South Africa, and they’re winning. As of September 2024, South African buyers have 27 Chinese car models to choose from. Looking ahead, it is estimated that Chinese manufacturers will capture around 20% of the new car market in South Africa by the end of 2024. Seat Seat, a Spanish car manufacturer, initially partnered with Fiat in 1982 before Volkswagen (VW) acquired it as a subsidiary in 1986. Known for its sporty hatchbacks, Seat sought to blend Italian styling with German engineering in models like the Ibiza. However, Seat’s appeal was overshadowed by competition within its own parent company; its hatchbacks struggled to rival the VW Polo and Golf. After years of declining production, Seat eventually exited the South African market in 2008. Although new sales ceased, VW dealerships continued supporting Seat models sold after 2006. Saab The Swedish carmaker Saab became defunct globally, leading to its exit from South Africa. Saab produced well-engineered sedans like the 9-3 and 9-5, often marketed with imagery evoking its aviation roots. In South Africa, Saab faced stiff competition from luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, particularly due to its front-wheel-drive configurations, which were less appealing to South African luxury sedan buyers at the time. In 2010, Saab’s South African division liquidated, and the few remaining Saab vehicles in the country have since become collectable. Cadillac Cadillac, the first major American car brand to leave South Africa, exited as General Motors (GM) pivoted to more profitable markets. Despite Cadillac’s value proposition—models like the Cadillac CTS delivered German-level performance at lower prices—South African drivers leaned toward German brands like BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz. Cadillac ultimately withdrew in 2010 due to weak sales. Daihatsu Known for its reliability, Japanese automaker Daihatsu specialized in compact “Kei-cars” designed for dense urban areas. The brand offered models such as the Charade, Sirion, and the compact Terios SUV. In 2015, Daihatsu announced its departure from South Africa, mirroring its retreat from other right-hand-drive markets, including New Zealand and Australia, as the company refocused its efforts on Asia. Chevrolet Chevrolet, another casualty of GM’s restructuring, relaunched in South Africa in 1997 but exited after 20 years. GM sold its minority stake in Isuzu, transferring operations to the bakkie manufacturer and closing its light commercial plant near Gqeberha. Chevrolet’s withdrawal was attributed to poor returns and a decision to prioritize the U.S. and Chinese markets. An “identity crisis” further weakened Chevrolet’s position as it shifted from high-profile models like the 4100 in the 1960s to mass-market, affordable vehicles in the 2000s. Although Chevrolet sales ended in 2018, Isuzu dealerships have continued to provide parts and after-sales support. Chrysler and Dodge In 2017, parent company Fiat Chrysler announced it would discontinue Chrysler and Dodge sales in South Africa, following a shift away from right-hand-drive markets. Sales continued until stock was depleted, while after-sales support remained available at Fiat dealerships. Fiat Chrysler’s successor, Stellantis, continues to market models under brands like Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and Jeep. Datsun Datsun re-entered South Africa in 2014 with the budget-friendly Go hatchback but withdrew in June 2022, following similar exits from Russia, Indonesia, and India. Nissan, Datsun’s parent company, attributed the decision to a broader strategy shift. Although new Datsun sales have ceased, Nissan continues to offer parts, after-sales service, and warranty support for Datsun owners in South Africa.

The six models range from budget-friendly choices to luxury offerings, capturing the essence of South Africa’s enduring love for the hatchback. This preference is partly due to hatchbacks’ practicality, versatility, and affordability, especially valuable in a market where compact, fuel-efficient, and accessible vehicles are in high demand. Kicking off the excitement is the new-generation Suzuki Swift, which is expected to launch by the end of October. With a starting price of R219,900, the Swift remains one of South Africa’s most budget-friendly cars, helping it retain its position as a favourite among local buyers. This price point places the Swift in an accessible range for a large portion of South African consumers, providing reliable and economical transportation without compromising on essential features. For many in South Africa, affordability is a significant factor, making models like the Swift highly appealing as they balance price with performance, which is critical for buyers seeking value in an everyday vehicle. On the opposite end of the market, premium options like the updated BMW 1 Series and the facelifted Audi A3 cater to buyers looking for a more upmarket driving experience. The new BMW 1 Series, which includes the high-performance M135 variant, starts at around R713,395, making it the most affordable choice in BMW’s South African lineup. The Audi A3 is also set to receive a facelift, offering modern styling and enhanced tech features, although pricing details remain under wraps. For consumers in South Africa, these luxury hatchbacks symbolise a step up in sophistication, combining compact convenience with high-end amenities. Such models are tailored to drivers who prioritise performance, luxury, and brand prestige in a vehicle that remains manoeuvrable and compact for city driving. Adding to the variety is the iconic Mini Cooper, which will soon be available in three- and five-door versions. With starting prices around R602,051, the Mini Cooper is aimed at a niche segment that values classic styling coupled with a modern driving experience. The availability of both body types allows consumers to pick a model that best suits their lifestyle, whether it’s the sporty compact or the roomier five-door for added versatility. Finally, South Africa will welcome its first fully electric hatchbacks from Stellantis with the launch of the Fiat 500e and the performance-oriented Abarth 500e. These electric models represent a new chapter for hatchbacks in the country, catering to the growing interest in EVs. Though likely priced at over R500,000, the Fiat 500e is expected to be an appealing option for eco-conscious urban drivers. Meanwhile, the Abarth 500e, equipped with a more powerful motor, targets enthusiasts looking for an electric vehicle that still delivers on performance. These models are among the first affordable EV hatchbacks in South Africa, positioning Stellantis as a significant player in the local electric vehicle market. With choices that span economic and eco-friendly to high-performance and luxurious, hatchbacks remain at the heart of South Africa’s automotive market. The country’s appreciation for these compact, adaptable vehicles is set to grow as these new models bring fresh options for drivers across a wide spectrum of tastes and budgets.

BusinessTech’s recent analysis of car licensing fees across the country’s nine provinces revealed that these costs are not uniform, with some provinces being significantly more affordable than others. Among the provinces, the North West stands out as the cheapest for vehicle licence renewals , offering substantial savings compared to more expensive regions like KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The cost of renewing a vehicle licence in South Africa is determined by the car’s unladen weight, also known as the tare weight, and this fee can vary slightly from province to province. Motorists who fail to renew their licences on time are given a 21-day grace period, after which penalties are applied. These penalties are calculated at 10% of the annual licensing fee for each month that the licence remains unpaid. For instance, if you own a vehicle weighing between 750kg and 1,000kg in Gauteng, your licensing fee would be R384 per year. Should you miss the deadline, you will incur a penalty of R38.40 for every month of delay. Although Gauteng has fairly average licensing costs, KwaZulu-Natal is the most expensive province in many weight categories. In the heaviest vehicle categories, the costs in KwaZulu-Natal surpass those in the North West by as much as R582, with significant disparities evident even in smaller vehicles. For vehicles with a tare weight of 250–500kg, typically motorcycles, the difference between the licence fees in Gauteng and North West is R90. This highlights the significant variation in vehicle licencing costs across the country. The argument for digital driver and vehicle licences has gained momentum, with experts suggesting that this shift could streamline the process and make renewals more affordable for motorists. Rob Handfield-Jones, a road safety expert, believes there is no technological reason South Africa shouldn’t have digital licences by now. He argues that if the South African Revenue Service (SARS) can collect taxes through an app, traffic enforcement can adopt similar technology to police licences. The transition to digital could potentially save money by reducing the need for physical licence discs and paperwork. Other experts share this view and advocate for reforms to the licencing system. Wayne Duvenage, CEO of the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), and Layton Beard from the Automobile Association (AA) have both called for extending the validity period of driving licences to ease the financial burden on motorists and alleviate the inefficiencies in the renewal process. While North West currently offers the lowest fees, it is important to note that they were last revised in mid-2019. In contrast, other provinces have made more recent adjustments, except the Eastern Cape, which hasn’t updated its fees since June 2018. Therefore, it’s possible that fee adjustments could be on the horizon for North West, although for now, it remains the most affordable province for motorists to renew their vehicle licences.

South Africa’s road safety crisis has reached critical levels, with unroadworthy vehicles significantly contributing to the high number of accidents. To address this growing concern, the government is ramping up its efforts through more frequent roadblocks and stricter enforcement of traffic laws. By 2025, the Department of Transport (DoT) plans to implement a 24/7 traffic policing system, which will increase the visibility of officers and enhance law enforcement across the country. One of the most notable initiatives is the Johannesburg Metro Police Department’s (JMPD) new “three-strike” system. Under this policy, any vehicle found with three or more critical defects during a roadblock will be immediately impounded. This includes vehicles with issues such as: Leaking engine oil , Defective lights , Faulty brakes , Worn tyres , Expired driving or car licences , and Cracked windscreens . These faults make vehicles unsafe for the road and contribute to many avoidable accidents. The JMPD’s firm stance underscores that compliance is non-negotiable, and drivers must ensure that their vehicles are properly maintained to avoid legal consequences and protect public safety. The push for stricter enforcement comes amid troubling road safety statistics in South Africa. Although there has been a slight decline in road fatalities—from 12,554 in 2020 to 11,883 in 2023—the numbers remain alarmingly high. Approximately 34 people die each day on South African roads, and human error accounts for 80% of fatalities during peak travel times like the festive season. The condition of vehicles is also a major contributor, with around 10% of registered vehicles deemed unroadworthy. With an average vehicle age of 11 years, many are poorly maintained, posing serious risks not only to drivers but also to pedestrians and other road users. To tackle these issues, the DoT has committed to expanding the 24/7 shift system for traffic officers. By March 2025, this system will be operational nationwide, ensuring continuous law enforcement and aiming to curb the lawlessness that has plagued the country’s roads. Currently, only the Western Cape and the National Traffic Police have adopted this shift schedule, but the plan is to extend it across all provinces, particularly in high-accident zones. This continuous policing will target both reckless driving and unroadworthy vehicles, aiming to reduce fatalities and make the roads safer for everyone. In addition to these measures, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is focused on professionalising traffic law enforcement. A new training initiative will require officers to have a post-matric diploma, raising the standard of policing. The RTMC also emphasised the economic cost of poor road safety, which is estimated to drain R200 billion annually from the South African economy. The Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) has welcomed the decline in fatalities but insists that more needs to be done. The association has repeatedly called for increased law enforcement and year-round public education campaigns to address reckless driving and vehicle safety. The government has responded by allocating budget resources for recruiting and training new officers and enhancing road safety campaigns. In summary, South Africa is facing a serious road safety crisis, with unroadworthy vehicles being a key factor in the high rate of road accidents. The government’s new roadblock strategies and the shift to 24/7 policing, alongside stricter enforcement measures like the three-strike system, aim to tackle these challenges head-on. These initiatives are crucial steps in reducing the number of road accidents and saving lives in the country.

Repairs by municipalities and road authorities are often sparse and delayed. Potholes frequently reappear within months of being patched in a seemingly never-ending cycle of repair and reformation. But why do potholes occur? Pothole formation Roads are made up of several layers, each with a specific function. First, the road surface soil is prepared and compressed. Next, a base layer composed of gravel is topped with a cement-stabilised gravel layer for added strength. Above this is a layer of crushed stone, followed by the final surface layer – an asphalt mix. Asphalt is a composite material made from aggregates (crushed rock) bound together by bitumen – a thick, sticky fluid derived from petroleum. The quality of these materials and the way they are applied is critical for road durability. The other crucial factor in road construction is drainage. Water is a road’s greatest enemy, and if proper drainage is not built into the design, water will infiltrate the layers beneath the surface. Unfortunately, in South Africa, road construction often neglects drainage systems, or the drainage becomes blocked and ineffective over time, accelerating road degradation. The asphalt mix used for many roads in South Africa is often substandard, resulting in early cracks on the road surface. These cracks allow water to seep into the layers beneath the asphalt, weakening both the road and the soil foundation. Inadequate drainage systems further compound the problem, causing water to pool underneath the road surface. Over time, as traffic moves over these weakened areas, the material erodes and collapses, forming potholes. Compounding this is a lack of timely road maintenance and monitoring. Once cracks begin to form, they should be addressed quickly to prevent potholes, but maintenance does not happen frequently enough to stop the issue at its source. Tarred roads generally require resurfacing to maintain their integrity after ten years. Unfortunately, this is often delayed, leading to more frequent and severe potholes. Alternatives Given the ongoing challenges with asphalt roads, alternative materials are being considered. One option is concrete, which is more durable and requires less maintenance than asphalt, making it an attractive option for roads, particularly in rural areas. However, concrete is more expensive to pour and produces more road noise. Despite these drawbacks, its longer lifespan could offset the initial costs and maintenance needs, making it a potential solution for South Africa’s rural roads. Another alternative currently under investigation by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is using recycled tyres as a road surface material. This innovative approach could offer both environmental and durability benefits, but the long-term reliability of these tyre-based roads is still being studied. South Africa’s problem with potholes is a multifaceted issue that includes poor road construction practices, inferior materials, inadequate drainage and insufficient maintenance. While asphalt roads will likely remain the standard in the short term, alternatives such as concrete and recycled tyre surfaces could provide more durable solutions in the future. To ensure safer and longer-lasting roads, South Africa must explore these options and improve its maintenance strategies to prevent our roads from falling through the cracks.

These organised groups feed off a high demand for affordable vehicles and parts, both locally and abroad. Recent crime statistics highlight the severity of this issue, with an alarming 60 hijackings and 96 vehicle thefts occurring daily in South Africa. This rampant theft often sees stolen cars either dismantled for parts at local chop shops or smuggled across the border to neighbouring countries. The growing rate of vehicle theft in South Africa is closely tied to economic pressures on vehicle owners. According to Fidelity Services Group, many car owners in South Africa are unable to afford parts directly from the original equipment manufacturers (OEM), which have become increasingly expensive. As a result, they turn to more affordable, often illegitimate sources for repairs. Although most people are not intentionally seeking stolen parts, the need for cheaper alternatives inadvertently supports criminal networks that supply parts through chop shops and stolen vehicles. Certain vehicle models, such as the Toyota Fortuner and Hilux, are frequent targets due to the high demand for their reliable turbo-diesel engines and accompanying parts. Fidelity also noted that about 30% of all hijacked and stolen vehicles in 2023 were smuggled across South Africa’s borders, with popular models like the Toyota Corolla Cross and RAV4 being in high demand. These vehicles, equipped to handle rugged terrain, are often smuggled into poorer African nations, where new cars are prohibitively expensive. Once across the border, these vehicles are sold at a much lower price, making them attractive to buyers in neighbouring countries. Vehicle tracking company Cartrack provides insight into the routes used by criminals to transport stolen cars out of the country. Botswana-bound vehicles are typically trafficked through the Sikwane border post in the North West province, while those headed for Mozambique often pass through KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) or Mpumalanga. In an audacious example of how far syndicates will go, a failed smuggling attempt in northern KZN revealed that criminals had constructed makeshift steel bridges to ferry vehicles over a concrete barrier separating Umkhayakude village from Mozambique. In Mpumalanga, criminals simply drive stolen cars over the border, while in the Northern Cape, vehicles are moved through the Vioolsdrift crossing into Namibia. Limpopo, being close to Zimbabwe, sees stolen cars dragged across the Limpopo River at low tide or transported by donkey carts. A Mercedes-Benz was recovered by the police after a smuggler got it stuck while trying to cross the Limpopo River. Once these vehicles make it into Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, or Namibia , they are fitted with fake number plates and often end up in Zambia. Zambia is a central hub for vehicle trafficking, given that it shares borders with eight countries, including Angola, Malawi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This connectivity makes it a key transit point for smuggling cars deeper into Africa. In the first three months of 2024, law enforcement recovered 36 stolen vehicles along the Mpumalanga-Mozambique border, where smuggling is rampant despite increased security measures. The problem of vehicle theft in South Africa is not new, but the government continues to take steps to curb it. In KwaZulu-Natal, the Department of Transport announced in September 2024 that the construction of a solid concrete wall along the South Africa-Mozambique border would be completed by early 2025. This barrier is intended to stem the flow of stolen vehicles and other goods crossing the border. Initially proposed in 2018, the project has faced delays due to contractor issues and environmental concerns, as the border region contains several sensitive wetlands. The 25-kilometre barrier is being constructed in three phases. The first phase covers an 8-kilometre stretch from Gate 6 to Tembe Elephant Park, followed by another 8-kilometre section extending west from iSimangaliso Wetland Park. The final 9-kilometer portion will stretch from Tembe Elephant Park to the Phongolo River. As of October 2024, approximately 7.4 kilometres of the first section have been completed, and phase one is expected to wrap up by December. KZN MEC Siboniso Duma noted that even the partial completion of the barrier has already shown results, with a significant reduction in cross-border vehicle smuggling. In 2023, about 30 stolen vehicles crossed into Mozambique each month, but this number has since decreased. Authorities hope that the full completion of the wall will further reduce vehicle theft and smuggling, though the problem remains deeply entrenched in local and regional dynamics. As South Africa grapples with this ongoing crisis, 2024’s crime statistics underscore the need for sustained efforts and cooperation to stem the tide of vehicle thefts that continue to fuel criminal enterprises across borders.

However, there is also some optimism for the industry in the near future as interest rates are cut and the load-shedding pause continues. This according to Billy Tom, the President of NAAMSA and Isuzu Motors SA CEO, speaking to the SABC . According to the Automotive Business Council’s September car sales figures, which were released this past week, annual car sales declined. During September, 44,081 new vehicles were sold, a 4.1% decrease compared to September 2023. “I think the year lived up to what we predicted,” Tom said. There were delays at the ports, high fuel prices, and rising interest rates, which affected consumers who were already heavily in debt. However, he explained that in the second half, things began to improve. Inflation dropped to 4.5%, which was the Reserve Bank’s aim, and fuel prices decreased. In addition, the respite in load-shedding has also boosted South Africa’s consumers and businesses. “We’ve had two-quarters of no load shedding, and it’s a relief to us, it’s a relief to the consumer, and we are forecasting an improvement towards year-end.” With possible interest rate cuts and fuel price decreases continuing, there’s optimism that vehicle sales will improve by the end of the year. “We are very comfortable that we will see a better end to this year.” Tom noted that this upward trend is expected to continue into next year. Further interest rate reductions, combined with falling fuel prices, are also expected to boost the market. “My prediction is that the first quarter of next year is going to see massive growth, because it takes about 3 to 6 months for the consumers to feel the impact of rate reduction.” While hope may be on the horizon for the vehicle industry, the car sales landscape is changing in many ways. For example, this year, a decrease in the number of vehicle exports was also seen. Tom explained that the 20% year-to-date decline, with a sharper 38% drop last month, is due to two main factors. First, some vehicle models are nearing the end of their life cycle, which naturally slows production as new models are prepared for launch. Second, the European Union, which receives 85% of South Africa’s vehicle exports, is experiencing a significant decline in demand, with double-digit negative growth in that market. Additionally, local issues such as port delays and the impacts of load shedding have further slowed exports. However, improvements in this area are expected as manufacturers ramp up production towards the end of the year. Tom said the vehicle industry is currently shrinking, with growth at about -6 %. Imported vehicles are also declining but at a slower rate of -3 %. Most of these imports are entry-level cars, which reflects the financial strain on consumers who are opting for more affordable options. In the long run, the concern is that if imports keep growing, it could lead to “de-industrialization” — where more cars are imported than exported, which could harm local manufacturing. This issue may need to be addressed by revisiting legislation, which will likely be discussed with the government at some point. While exports and new vehicle sales may have lagged this year, new passenger vehicle sales actually increased modestly by 2%. This, Tom explained, was driven mostly by the rental car sector, which accounted for 28% of sales last month, an increase from the usual 15%. This growth is largely due to two factors: corporate rentals either expanding or replacing their fleets and rental companies preparing for the busy festive season as tourism returns to pre-COVID levels. Another major way that the vehicle industry is changing is through the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs). More people are making the shift to electric vehicles, and this past week, South Africa launched an EV minibus taxi. Regarding the contribution of electric vehicles, Tom explained that while there’s been significant growth, it’s starting from a small base. Currently, EVs account for only about 1.5% of vehicle sales, with most of these being hybrids, at around 85.5%. Hybrids are expected to be the next big step before consumers fully transition to electric vehicles. The South African government has released a white paper on EVs, but industry players are still discussing its contents with the government. Infrastructure, such as charging stations, is crucial, especially considering the country’s electricity issues and range anxiety for EV drivers. Companies like Isuzu are taking a phased approach, focusing on alternatives like compressed natural gas rather than moving directly to electric vehicles, Tom added. The expectation is that hybrids will play a larger role in the transition period, and further engagement with the government is necessary to ensure proper policies are in place. The shift to EVs will likely be gradual rather than immediate.

This marks a period of transition in the automotive industry, with several brands making strategic decisions to replace older models or shift to new manufacturing hubs. While new cars have been introduced to South African roads, a range of models have been pulled for reasons that vary from dwindling sales to shifting production strategies and changing consumer preferences. One of the more significant changes comes from Citroen, which is undergoing a substantial overhaul of its lineup in South Africa. The brand has moved away from importing vehicles from Europe and is now focusing on sourcing models from India. This shift has resulted in the discontinuation of the European versions of the C3 and C3 Aircross, with new Indian-built models taking their place. While these cars share the same names as their predecessors, their specifications are noticeably different, reflecting Citroen’s new direction in offering more affordable and locally relevant options. In a similar vein, Honda has decided to drop its WR-X from the South African market. The WR-X’s exit will make way for the Honda Elevate, a new compact SUV that offers a fresh take on the small SUV segment. Honda is betting on the Elevate to capture a greater share of the market, appealing to customers with its updated features and modern design. Another example of this shift is Mahindra’s decision to replace the XUV300 with the new XUV 3XO. As Mahindra continues to expand its footprint in South Africa, it’s updating its range with more competitive, feature-packed models aimed at offering value for money, which the XUV 3XO represents. By introducing newer models, Mahindra is catering to the growing demand for advanced tech and safety features in compact SUVs. Volkswagen (VW) has also made notable adjustments to its offerings, discontinuing the entry-level Amarok bakkie. VW’s decision was largely influenced by the arrival of newer, more sophisticated models in the Amarok range that offer better performance and features. While the entry-level Amarok served the market well for years, VW is focusing on pushing more premium models that align with its broader brand strategy. Other notable exits from the South African market include the Hyundai Kona, Nissan Qashqai, Jeep Renegade, Mazda BT-50, and Toyota C-HR. For these models, the decision to pull them from showrooms was largely driven by declining sales. As competition in their respective segments increased, these vehicles struggled to maintain a foothold in the market. Manufacturers like Hyundai and Toyota are increasingly focusing on newer, more popular models that better align with customer demands for fuel efficiency, technology, and safety features. Suzuki has discontinued the Vitara from its SUV lineup. It believes its newer models, such as the Fronx and Grand Vitara, provide better coverage for the SUV segment. These new models bring advanced features and a more modern design, making the older Vitara somewhat redundant in Suzuki’s current lineup. The company has shifted its focus toward these newer offerings to stay competitive in the highly saturated compact SUV market. The discontinuation of these cars in South Africa reflects broader global trends in the automotive industry. Brands are re-evaluating their lineups to better meet customer expectations, reduce costs, and incorporate the latest in technology and safety features. As electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid models grow in popularity, many of the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) models are being phased out or replaced by more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly alternatives. In some cases, as seen with Citroen and Mahindra, manufacturers are shifting production to lower-cost regions to maintain profitability while offering more affordable options to consumers. As South Africa’s automotive landscape continues to evolve, consumers can expect to see more modern, tech-savvy cars taking over from older models, shaping a new era of motoring in the country. 11 cars being discontinued in South Africa in 2024 are listed below.

The new vehicle is accompanied by an integrated new electric vehicle (EV) business model and charging infrastructure product called Flex EV. GoMetro said that the 15-seater eKamva has a range of more than 200km between charges. It also fast-charges within 75 minutes via a 60kW DC charger and slow-charges overnight for 10 hours. Depending on the fuel price (inland vs coastal) and the distance of the taxi route, eKamva could deliver an estimated 40-70% cost savings over traditional vehicles on running costs. The eKamva currently undergoing homologation (being certified compliant with local safety and vehicle standards) by the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications. Since 2023, the project team, consisting of GoMetro, Powerfleet (formerly MiX Telematics), HSW, ACDC Dynamics, and various entities within Stellenbosch University’s Faculty of Engineering, has conducted rigorous and extensive testing on the existing taxi route in and around Stellenbosch. Minibus taxis transport millions of South Africans daily but contribute an estimated 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in South Africa alone and consume two billion tonnes of fuel a year. flx EV is in the process of developing charging hubs with partners across South Africa, with the first hubs slated for development in Century City and Stellenbosch. Project lead Rudi Kriel says historical data gathered by GoMetro indicates that replacing urban taxi and shuttle fleets with eKamvas will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13.7 tonnes per vehicle per annum. “Most taxis spend up to three hours a day between morning and evening peak hours at the ranks we have analysed, more than sufficient time to fast-charge an eKwamva,” said Kriel. “EVs have fewer breakdowns than internal combustion vehicles, and are cheaper to run, which leads to increased profitability per vehicle – and they have a longer life expectancy.” “EVs also reduce nitrous oxides, sulphur oxides and particulate matter (known as PM2.5 particles) in the air, improving community health, a major cost factor for the government.” “They (PM2.5s) are small enough to enter deep into the lungs when inhaled, causing wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and difficulty breathing – and some may even get into our bloodstreams.” Professor Thinus Booysen, Research Chair in the Internet of Things at Stellenbosch University, led the team of testing experts. “The informal taxi sector must transform to EVs, but little is known about their energy requirements,” said Booysen. “This unknown is overshadowed by our energy scarcity and coal dependence on the electricity supply side. This collaborative project will ensure we are prepared for and carefully manage this exciting transition.” Dr Bernard Bekker, Associate Director of Stellenbosch University’s Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies, said that the future electrification of the transport section in South Africa raises significant technical and regulatory challenges when it comes to integrating electric transport into our existing grid infrastructure. These challenges are also unique to South Africa, where minibus taxis represent a much larger proportion of the future electrical fleet than, for example, in Europe or the USA. “The availability of a real-life electric minibus taxi to inform our research activities will provide very valuable inputs into addressing these challenges,” said Bekker.

Popular travel destinations such as members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States all recognise South African licences. However, the terms and conditions vary between nations. Some countries permit you to use your South African licence for only a few months, while others may allow you to drive with it until your licence expires. Although many countries accept your South African driver’s licence, it’s highly recommended to obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) before travelling abroad if you plan to drive. The IDP provides several benefits beyond just permission to drive. For instance, in countries where English is not the official language, the IDP acts as a translation of your South African licence, making it easier for local authorities to verify your driving credentials. It translates your licence into multiple languages, including the five official United Nations languages, which can prove helpful if you’re stopped by law enforcement or involved in an accident. Furthermore, the IDP serves as a form of validation for your domestic licence. In many cases, car rental agencies, insurance companies, and even hotels may ask for an IDP as an additional form of identification. This makes the permit not only valuable for road use but also useful when securing services tied to driving or mobility in foreign countries. You can apply for an IDP through the Automobile Association (AA) of South Africa either online or in person at one of their accredited sales agents. The process is generally straightforward, but it’s recommended to do this well ahead of your trip to avoid any last-minute complications. For those who are relocating abroad permanently, it’s crucial to obtain a driver’s licence confirmation letter, often referred to as a driver’s licence certificate. This document proves the validity of your South African driver’s licence and is often required to convert your licence into the equivalent one for your destination country. This confirmation serves as formal recognition that your licence is legitimate in South Africa and allows you to apply for the corresponding local licence. Without this, many countries will not let you simply transfer your South African licence, and you may need to take local driving tests to obtain a driver’s permit. However, not all countries accept these confirmation letters, and in those cases, you might be required to apply for a new licence from scratch in your destination country. Depending on the country’s regulations, this could involve taking driving tests, both practical and theoretical. If you’re unsure about a country’s specific requirements, it’s essential to research thoroughly before you travel or relocate. Countries that have formal agreements with South Africa over long-term visitors and immigrants driving on their roads often have specific regulations. For instance, some may allow you to use your South African driver’s licence for an extended period before requiring a conversion, while others may insist on a conversion right away. These agreements vary, so checking the specific conditions for each country is crucial to avoid legal issues. Document concierge services like Apostil.co.za can assist in clarifying what the process entails for each country. It’s important to note that this is not an exhaustive list of countries that accept South African driver’s licences, and there are often additional terms and conditions. Some countries may even have regional differences in how they handle foreign drivers, so it’s critical to understand the traffic laws of the particular country or region you’re visiting. Ensuring compliance with local driving regulations helps prevent unnecessary fines, legal trouble, or even imprisonment in extreme cases. Therefore, doing thorough research beforehand can save you a lot of trouble on the road. In summary, while driving with a South African licence is possible in many countries, getting an IDP and, if necessary, a driver’s licence confirmation letter ensures a smoother driving experience abroad. Whether you’re travelling for a short trip or relocating permanently, knowing the regulations of your destination country can make a world of difference in avoiding complications. According to document concierge company Apostil.co.za, the countries that have struck agreements with South Africa are shown in the table below.

Uber Safari will be exclusively available on the company’s app from October 1 to February 1, offering people in Cape Town a day trip to look to see the big five (lions, elephants, buffaloes, leopards, and rhinos). Uber has partnered with Aquila Private Game Reserve, one of the country’s most famous wildlife conservancies, which is about two hours from the City. “We’ve designed our ‘Go Anywhere’ series to help our customers book bucket list adventures with the Uber convenience they know and love,” said Frans Hiemstra, Regional General Manager of Uber in the Middle East and Africa. “With Uber Safari – one of our wildest offerings to date – our Reserve technology makes it easier than ever to unlock an epic South African travel experience.” The full-day trip includes a pickup in Cape Town in an Uber Safari-branded vehicle.

Although these vehicles are often attractive due to their lower prices, their risks range from job destruction to serious safety concerns. According to Vehiclefacts, grey vehicle imports refer to used vehicles brought into South Africa via unauthorised channels, bypassing official dealership networks and the government’s regulation framework. These vehicles are sold at a lower price than those imported through official means, making them attractive to cost-conscious buyers. A significant impact of Grey vehicles is the massive loss of government revenue. In 2022, it was estimated that South Africa lost R8 billion in taxes due to illegal imports. Import duties, VAT and other taxes are bypassed when vehicles are smuggled or imported illegally. This shortfall directly affects all South Africans, depriving the government of critical funds that could otherwise be invested in infrastructure, education and public services. These vehicles are also sold without warranties, and spare parts are not readily available. Although the starting price looks attractive, these vehicles will leave buyers with no transport and no recourse on the sellers. Moreover, the influx of grey vehicles undermines the industry by reducing the demand for new and used cars sold via authorised dealers. Therefore, jobs across the sector—including sales, manufacturing, and after-sales services—are at risk. The growth of Grey imports is also set to lead to job losses across the automotive sector, with job losses not limited to dealerships, as repairs, parts supply, and logistics, exacerbating unemployment in a country already grappling with high joblessness rates. Grey vehicle imports also bypass local safety and environmental standards, posing serious risks to drivers and other road users. Vehicles imported via unauthorised channels may lack crucial safety features such as airbags, ABS brakes and proper crash protection. They may also not meet the country’s emission standards, contributing to environmental degradation. The Way Forward VehicleFacts said that it is imperative to take decisive steps to eradicate Grey vehicle imports, which can be achieved via: “ Stricter Enforcement: Strengthen border controls, customs operations and penalties for those caught importing or selling Grey vehicles. Vehicle Authentication: South Africa has laws that require the authentication of used vehicles when purchased or traded by consumers at dealers. Once sold, before licensing takes place, vehicles should be verified through Microdot Authentication to confirm that they are legitimate and that they were introduced as new vehicles. The vehicles should also be inspected as they could have had previous accident damage and/or be re-built.” Read : Ramaphosa’s message to NHI boycotters in South Africa Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

Yesterday, September 19, the SARB’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously decided to drop the repo rate by 25 basis points from its 15-year high of 8.25% to 8.0% – in line with expectations. The prime interest rate thus also dropped from 11.75% to 11.50%. Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said that the MPC reached a consensus of a 25 basis point cut, stating that a less restrictive stance was consistent with sustainably lower inflation over the medium term. The latest inflation print for South Africa in August was 4.4%, a three-year low, and below the SARB’s target midpoint of 4.5%. The rate cut follows similar moves from other international central banks. The US FED cut interest rates by 50 basis points a day before the MPC’s decision. South African assets have performed relatively well in recent months. The rand has strengthened more than many of its emerging market peers, while long-term yields have moderated and spreads over US rates have narrowed. How much you’ll save on your bond after the latest interest rate cut in South Africa The terms of a car loan depend on several factors, so we have decided to look at the value of a car with no deposit or trade-in and a prime-linked interest rate. According to WesBank, the average amount for a new vehicle financed through their institution was approximately R410,000. Using Wesbank’s fiance calculator, the average South African car purchaser would save R51 monthly on car repayments with the 25 basis point cut in interest rates. The savings increase as the car’s value rises, with a R500,000 car saving R63 per month, while a R1 million car would save R126. Further savings can be expected following the SARB’s latest decision. Kganyago noted that the SARB’s forecast sees rates moving towards neutral next year, stabilising slightly above 7%. This means that another 75-100 basis points worth of cuts are on the cards for South Africa.

The group said that August presented a mixed picture for used car sales, showing a contraction of 8.2% year-on-year. However, there was a small positive, with monthly sales rising marginally by 1%. August saw sales of 31,877 used cars that generated a value of just over R13 billion,down 6.8% year-on-year. Japanese brand Toyota maintained its position as the top-selling used car brand, ahead of Volkswagen and Ford. However, Suzuki and Kia were the only brands in the top ten to show year-on-year growth, with sales increases of 40% and 11%, respectively, and monthly growth figures of 11% and 8%. The only change in the brand ranking was Suzuki, which outsold Nissan to move up a spot and claim 7th place. “Facilitating that movement up the brand ranking were the 598 sales of the Suzuki Swift, a figure that equates to more than a third of Suzuki’s 1,612 sales in August. The popular Japanese hatchback, which has an average selling price of R194,248 for three-year-old models, has climbed seven places in a year from 13th to 6th position,” said AutoTrader CEO, George Mienie. Japanese models continued to excel, with a new contender, the Toyota Starlet, making its way into the top ten most-sold used models. Averaging a sales price of R233,635 for two-year-old models, the Toyota Starlet posted sales of 482 units, helping the hatchback climb from eleventh to tenth place in August. Still, with sales of 1,930 units, it was the Ford Ranger that continued to head up model sales ahead of bakkie opponent Toyota Hilux and the Volkswagen Polo. Retaining the variant sales trophy was the VW Polo Vivo 1.4 with 942 transactions ahead of stablemate VW Polo 1.0TSI and bakkie Toyota Hilux 2.8GD-6. While the average used car price is still up 1.5% year-on-year, the good news is that in August the average selling price of a used car declined by a smidgen to R408,488, a 0.2% month-on-month reduction.

However, he said that shoppers should make sure that pre-loved vehicles were definitely loved, flagging safety concerns for those that have not been looked after. Herbert outlined eight key checks that any prospective buyers should look into before making a purchase, just to ensure they’re on the right track. Go with the professionals “Ideally, the first tip is to select reputable vehicle dealerships. These have the support of OEMS behind them and ensure their used vehicles have undergone checks already,” he said. Additionally, there are organisations that can provide an assessment of a vehicle and alert you to any potential issues. Tread tips Check tyres for wear that may risk your safety. “Check the Tread Wear Indicator (TWI). It should not be less than 1.6mm. If it is nearing this, negotiate tyre replacement into your deal. Additionally, look for cracks, bulges or uneven wear, which can indicate a problem with alignment or the suspension.” Put on the brakes During your test drive, check the brakes. “Apply them in different driving scenarios from an emergency stop to a gentle traffic light stop. The response should be prompt, even and have no unusual noises, grinding or squeaking. Soft brake pedals can also indicate a brake fluid change is needed or even be a sign of worn brake pads.” Shine the way Do not forget the lights and turn signals. “Ask someone to check that each light works properly. Additionally, ensure the headlight cover has not become cloudy or oxidised as this affects visibility particularly at night.” Servicing safety A full service history provides transparency about whether safety maintenance was completed. “It is a record of whether oil changes, brake checks and major services were undertaken. It provides reassurance your vehicle is at less risk of mechanical failure that can cause crashes.” Check the chip Inspect all the windows. “Even small chips affect visibility. Cracks can also quickly grow not only reducing visibility but also affecting structural strength of a windscreen.” Fluid savvy Check the fluid levels. “Low levels, dark oil or transmission fluid or a burnt smell is a sign of a potential issue but also indicates the dealership did not do their due diligence.” Primary safety Do not overlook the seatbelts and airbags. “Inspect the seatbelts for fraying and ability to retract on their own. Airbags can be problematic if the warning light remains on after starting. While airbags can last a lifetime, airbag sensors can become less effective after ten years,” said Herbert.

Standard Bank said that roughly 5.7% of first-time buyers fall behind their repayments or change to a more affordable car in the first year. Standard Bank said that the industry has recorded an increase in these cases in recent years. “It is common for first-time buyers to be caught off guard when interest rates rise. In recent years, the rising cost of living has made this situation even more challenging,” said Doret Jooste, Standard Bank’s Head of Money Management and Advisory. Although a car can be a major asset, the significant purchase can be daunting, which leads to emotional decisions. Standard Bank provided the following tip for first-time car buyers, but many of the same tips can still be applied to those who already own cars. Cost A common mistake is purchasing a car based on the highest monthly payment that one can afford. As a rule of thumb, allocating up to 20% of one’s monthly income to all car-related expenses is best. “If your monthly income is R25,000, your car instalment should be lower than R5,000 to make room for insurance and fuel costs,” said Jooste. Standard Bank data showed that middle-income customers spend roughly 20% of their monthly income on their vehicle instalment alone. That said, over 51% of this client base spends over 20% of its monthly income on repayments. The higher-income groups in the bank’s Prestige and Private Banking client bases spend an average of 13% of their monthly income on vehicle instalments. “Even within this group, one in five individuals allocates more than 20% of their income to car repayments,” added Jooste. “This suggests that a significant portion of their income is being spent on the car alone and does not include other additional vehicle-related expenses such as paying for insurance, fuel and maintenance.” The role of a downpayment The size of a downpayment plays a huge role in keeping one’s monthly instalments below one’s maximum budget. “Aim for 10% to 20% of the car’s price as a down payment to lower the size of the loan you’ll need and your interest rate.” The length of the loan An instalment sale agreement can allow someone to repay their loan plus interest for up to 84 months, with one able to add a balloon payment to lower repayments. This means that one can defer the payment of the balloon amount to the need of one’s contract as the last repayment amount. It is also worth noting that customers who cannot afford to pay a balloon in full at the end of a loan term can also respread and pay off the amount over a period of 12 to 36 months. It is worth noting that customers who cannot afford to pay the balloon in full at the end of the loan term can respread and pay off this amount for a period between 12 and 36 months. The type of interest rate Monthly car payments have increased a large amount over the last four years. Standard Bank expects interest rates to be cut by 50 basis points by the end of the year. Although forecasts suggest advantages for linked interest rates, Standard Bank’s Head of Business Solution Design, Marelize Lombard, warned that both options have pros and cons. “Fixed rates offer predictability and protection from rate hikes but are usually higher. While prime-linked rates can be lower, they pose a risk of higher repayments if rates rise, complicating budgeting,” said Lombard. The dangers of not paying a loan back on time Failure to pay instalments can negatively affect one’s credit score. Standard Bank said that it is best to proactively contact their vehicle loan provider of bank to seek assistance if they can’t afford to make repayments. Jooste and Lombard said that first-time buyers should carefully review their finances and thoroughly research their financing options before committing to a new car.

In a welcome development for South African motorists, petrol and diesel prices are set to drop once again, marking the fourth consecutive cut at the pumps. This decline comes on the back of a stable global oil market, a stronger rand against the US dollar, and positive trends in investor confidence in South Africa’s economy. For motorists, petrol prices will drop by 92 cents per litre, while diesel prices will fall by between 79 and 105 cents per litre. These adjustments reflect a significant easing of costs at the pumps and bring some relief to consumers after months of high fuel prices. The reductions will take effect in September, with the new prices regulated and adjusted by the government, as they are on the first Wednesday of every month. Fuel prices in South Africa are influenced by a combination of international and domestic factors. On the international front, the price of petrol is largely determined by the cost an importer would incur to purchase it from a refinery abroad and ship it to South Africa. This cost is then augmented by government-imposed taxes, levies, and margins, which together make up the final retail price of fuel. The Central Energy Fund (CEF) plays a critical role in this process, calculating daily prices for petrol and diesel and illuminating paraffin on behalf of the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE). However, the price changes that motorists see at the pumps are based on a monthly average of the previous period’s data. This results in a lag between global price trends and local price adjustments, with South Africa’s fuel prices typically reflecting international shifts about a month later. The recent decrease in petrol prices comes after a relatively strong start to economic recoveries in early August. During this time, the rand strengthened against the dollar, buoyed by increased optimism in the country’s Government of National Unity (GNU) and an influx of investment. Although the rand experienced some volatility earlier in the year, with concerns over a potential recession in the United States, it regained strength as those fears subsided. This stronger rand, combined with stabilising global oil prices, has paved the way for the current cuts. Global oil prices have remained balanced despite market fluctuations. The average price of Brent Crude oil, a key benchmark, fell from $83.55 to $78.54 per barrel during the review period. This decline was largely driven by increased oil production from major producing nations, despite concerns over lower demand and the potential for interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Investment strategist Izak Odendaal of Old Mutual Wealth highlighted that while oil prices have remained relatively stable, they are subject to cyclical fluctuations and may eventually recover. However, for the time being, the stabilised oil market presents an advantage for consumers, as lower fuel costs directly benefit motorists. How much motorists will save per tank of petrol This recent price cut also comes after a period of significant price increases earlier in the year. From January to May 2024, the price of petrol rose by as much as R3.00 per litre, with inland unleaded petrol reaching a high of R25.49 for 95 octane and R25.15 for 93 octane. These increases came close to the record highs experienced in July 2022, when prices peaked at R26.74 for 95 octane and R26.31 for 93 octane per litre. However, the downward trend in recent months has been equally significant. Since May, petrol prices have retreated by as much as R3.36 per litre, providing relief to South African motorists. The latest round of cuts means that drivers can expect to save at the pumps, though the exact amount will depend on the size of their vehicle’s fuel tank. BusinessTech calculated the average petrol tank size based on the top-selling cars and bakkies in South Africa for 2024. The tanks ranged from 37 litres (found in models like the Suzuki Swift and Toyota Starlet) to 80 litres (in the Toyota Hilux and Ford Ranger). The weighted average tank size for these vehicles is approximately 56.8 litres. Based on this average, motorists filling up with Petrol 93 will save about R191 per tank, while those opting for Petrol 95 will save roughly R188 since the highs in May. As both local and global factors continue to influence fuel prices, the recent stability in the oil market and the strengthening of the rand offer a welcome reprieve for consumers. The table below outlines the savings for owners of popular vehicles when filling up with inland Petrol 93 or Diesel 0.05%.

As of September 2024, South African buyers have 27 Chinese car models to choose from. The overall automotive market in South Africa has faced challenges in recent years. In the first quarter of 2024, new vehicle sales declined 5.6% compared to the same period in 2023. Various industry experts attribute this drop to several economic pressures, including high interest rates, rising fuel costs, and broader economic difficulties. These factors have created a challenging environment for both consumers and car manufacturers. Amid this economic strain, many car buyers have shifted their focus toward more affordable vehicles offering better value. This shift in consumer behaviour has created a significant opportunity for Chinese carmakers to thrive in South Africa, as they provide budget-friendly alternatives to the typically more expensive premium vehicle brands. With affordability becoming a key driver of consumer choice, Chinese brands have successfully tapped into this growing demand for low-cost options, positioning themselves as strong contenders in the market. One of the clearest indicators of Chinese car brands’ success in South Africa is their growing presence in vehicle financing deals. Data from Standard Bank’s vehicle finance division reveals that the share of Chinese brands in the bank’s new car financing deals increased from just over 6% in 2022 to 7.4% in the first half of 2024. This growth is particularly impressive given the broader decline in new car sales nationwide, highlighting the increasing preference for Chinese models. Among the Chinese brands, GWM Haval continues to lead the pack as the most popular brand financed by Standard Bank, followed closely by Chery and BAIC. These brands have gained the most traction in Gauteng, accounting for 54% of all Chinese car financing deals, while KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape also contribute to their growing popularity. In addition to new car sales, the used car market for Chinese brands is also expanding at a rapid pace. Standard Bank reports that the proportion of used Chinese cars financed by the bank rose from 20% in 2022 to 36% by July 2024. This shift towards used cars reflects a broader trend in the South African automotive market, as consumers increasingly opt for second-hand vehicles to avoid the high costs associated with buying new ones. Currently, used cars account for 70% of Standard Bank’s vehicle finance deals, underscoring the shift toward more affordable options. Looking ahead, it is estimated that Chinese manufacturers will capture around 20% of the new car market in South Africa by the end of 2024. This would mark a significant achievement for these brands, which have steadily grown their presence in the country in recent years. Leading the charge among the Chinese automakers are Haval and Chery, whose sales have skyrocketed. Data from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) reveals that Haval sold approximately 19,904 units by mid-2024, a dramatic increase from just 872 units in 2019. This growth trajectory is a clear indication of the brand’s increasing popularity among South African consumers. Chery, another key player, is expected to report similarly impressive numbers, further cementing its position in the market. Other Chinese brands, including BAIC, Beijing, GWM, Jaecoo, and Omoda, are also driving the growth in South Africa’s affordable car segment. These manufacturers offer a range of vehicles that appeal to budget-conscious buyers looking for reliable and stylish options without breaking the bank. Their competitive pricing, combined with an improving reputation for quality and performance, has allowed them to carve out a significant share of the market. The growing success of Chinese car brands in South Africa reflects a broader trend of consumers gravitating toward more cost-effective vehicles in response to economic pressures. As the local market continues to evolve, it is clear that Chinese automakers are well-positioned to capture an even larger share of South Africa’s automotive sector in the coming years, providing a welcome alternative for budget-conscious buyers seeking value for money.

A delegation featuring Eastern Cape MEC for Transport Xolile Nqathad and the N2 Wild Coast Road Political Oversight Committee (POC) visited the Mtentu Bridge construction site after the contract was re-awarded in late 2022. “Our visit forms part of the work of the Political Oversight Committee to monitor how the work is progressing, and we are happy with the report received from SANRAL and the progress we have seen on site, particularly with the previous stop-and-start on the Mtentu contract,” said Nqatha. He was pleased with the appointment of a new contractor, as community projects, job creation, small contractor development, and more work were in the pipeline. “Grade 1 contractors will grow to higher grades by the end of this contract. That is development in the true sense. We greatly appreciate the leadership role played by SANRAL for putting us where we are now, and we say big up to the leadership of SANRAL, the Board and the Regional Manager,” said Nqatha. The project has spent R250 million since breaking ground in 2023, employing 248 local labourers. Construction of the connecting the Mtentu Bridge and Msikaba Bridge is also commencing well, with 445 job opportunities created and 41 targeted enterprise subcontracted thus far. The Mtentu Bridge is set to be the highest bridge in Africa, with a maximum height of about 223 metres. It will also be one of the longest main-span balanced cantilever bridges globally, with a main span of 260 metres. The bridge forms part of Sanral’s N2 Wild Cost Road (N2WCR) programme, which includes a 410km stretch of road from East London to the Mtamvuna River on the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal border. The POC also received an in-depth report on the various projects that form within the N2WCR. The report stated that R665.6 million had been spent on the Msikaba Bridge contract, with 48 service providers and 61 subcontractors participating. Moreover, SANRAL is also making headway in other parts of the N2WCR. “In August, we were able to finally announce the imminent construction of the N2WCR Section 20 between the Lingeni Intersection (km 15.40) and the Msikaba Bridge (km 33.02), valued at R2.2 billion, which will begin in early 2025,” said Mbulelo Peterson, SANRAL’s Regional Manager for the Southern Region. “This contract was delayed by litigation after we awarded it in 2023.” He noted that the stretch of road is set to produce another 400 job opportunities.

Photo: Smec Larger expansions SANRAL also plans a host of other projects for South Africa. The group is set to inject roughly R50 billion into the economy during the 2024/25 financial year via several road project tenders. Earlier this week, in September 2024, SANRAL said that it is currently evaluating 96 tenders worth R35 billion, while 86 contracts worth R15 billion have already been awarded since the start of the 2024/25 financial year on 1 April 2024. The tenders currently in evaluation are: 34 tenders in the Northern Region (Gauteng, North West, Limpopo and Mpumalanga) worth R16.5 billion; 24 tenders in the Southern Region (Eastern Cape) worth R3.8 billion; 12 tenders in the Western Region (Western Cape and Northern Cape) worth R2 billion; 12 tenders in the Eastern Region (KwaZulu-Natal and Free State) worth R11.7 billion; and 14 tenders at Head Office, worth R839 million.

BYD has expressed interest to work and invest in South Africa, according to Parks Tau, the country’s trade, industry and competition minister. “It’s now about taking it to the next level,” he said. Tau pointed to South Africa’s extensive car-production experience and its access to key resources such as lithium and manganese that are key to battery making. “We’ve got the minerals that are indispensable,” he said. Leaders from some 50 African countries gathered in Beijing this week for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or Focac, where there have been frequent calls for China to help industrialize African economies by increasing technology transfers and beefing up manufacturing. Earlier this week, Tau accompanied the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to BYD’s Shenzhen headquarters, where they were personally greeted by founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu who sought to wow them with the company’s advanced EV technology and car features. Chinese EV makers are facing geopolitical pressures as they push to sell their cars on international markets. The US has slapped 100% tariffs, effectively shutting them out, and the European Union introduced new measures on July 5 that raised duties on Chinese-made EVs to as high as 48%. Both have cited Beijing’s financial backing for the industry and the overcapacity it has encouraged. Tau said such moves have forced the Chinese to rethink what their approach is to international expansion. “But our commitment is to continue to work on this relationship,” he told Bloomberg News on the sidelines of Focac. He said his government was talking to BYD as well as other Chinese companies in the EV-related industry. “They’ve been part of the conversations we are having here, primarily focusing on ensuring that industrialization happens on the African continent.” On Thursday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged $50 billion in financial support for Africa over the next three years, including $10 billion in investment by Chinese companies. His No. 2, Li Qiang, on Friday pushed for deeper integration into the continent’s economies. “Chinese companies in Africa should continue to localize their operations, create more local jobs, train more local talent, and further contribute to local people’s well-being,” Li said. While the consumer market for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles across Africa remains somewhat nascent, Chinese companies in the EV space are making early bets, particularly investments in the supply chain. Xiaomi Corp Chairman Lei Jun said at Focac that his company wants to increase investment in Africa and strengthen cooperation with local firms in areas such as EV. BYD has entered several African markets, including Tunisia, Rwanda, Morocco and South Africa, following a similar trend of other Chinese auto brands, including SAIC Motors and smaller upstart Xpeng.

In 2019, the Kouga Municipality, in partnership with Scottish firm MacRebur and local civil engineering experts, embarked on this innovative pilot project, which has since shown significant promise. Five years after its completion, the plastic-infused road has demonstrated remarkable durability compared to traditional tar roads. The DA-led Kouga Municipality first proposed the concept of a plastic road in 2016, and the project gained official approval in 2019. Horatio Hendricks, the municipality’s executive mayor, explained that the region faced a backlog of road repairs totalling more than R500 million. The municipality lacked the financial resources to address this issue through conventional road-building methods. Thus, the idea of using plastic waste as a substitute for traditional asphalt emerged as both an eco-friendly and financially feasible alternative. The plastic road in Jeffreys Bay uses a unique mixture of plastic waste, including plastic bags, which are melted down and integrated into the road’s asphalt. Each kilometre of the road can incorporate up to 1.8 million plastic bags, significantly reducing waste that would otherwise end up in landfills or oceans. These roads are not only a solution to plastic waste but also provide a stronger and more durable surface than traditional tar roads. Water, one of the primary causes of potholes, is less likely to penetrate the plastic-infused asphalt, ensuring that the road remains in better condition for longer periods. At the end of 2023, Hendricks noted that the plastic road still appeared brand new, while a nearby traditional tar road, built in the same year, was already showing signs of wear and tear. Hendricks referred to the plastic road as a “triple threat” due to its environmental, economic, and infrastructural benefits. By using plastic waste, the road contributes to waste management solutions and reduces the need for raw materials in road construction. The expectation is that these roads will last twice as long as their traditional counterparts, reducing the financial burden of road repairs and minimising the backlog of infrastructure projects. The success of plastic roads has far-reaching implications beyond just better infrastructure. Experts argue that adopting this technology on a larger scale could revolutionize the plastic waste value chain in South Africa. By creating a financial incentive for recycling, plastic roads could spur job creation in the recycling and construction industries, further boosting the local economy. Moreover, plastic roads address two critical issues facing the country: waste management and infrastructure maintenance. With South Africa grappling with rising plastic waste levels, plastic roads offer an effective solution to repurpose this waste while delivering cost-effective, long-lasting roads. The reduction in the frequency and cost of road repairs also provides municipalities with the opportunity to allocate funds to other pressing needs. 200 tons of plastic-infused tarmac was also laid on the N3 highway between Durban and Johannesburg in the same year. Early signs suggest that this project will deliver similar results, providing a more sustainable and long-lasting road surface for one of South Africa’s busiest transportation routes. While the results from Jeffreys Bay and the N3 project are promising, widespread adoption of plastic roads across South Africa is yet to be seen. BusinessTech reached out to the Department of Transport for comment on their views regarding the positive signs and what this could mean for the future of road construction in the country, including any plans for the current financial year, but it did not respond by the time of writing. As South Africa continues to explore innovative solutions to its infrastructure challenges, plastic roads represent a significant opportunity. If successful on a larger scale, they could transform road construction, reduce plastic waste, and alleviate some of the financial strain on municipalities tasked with maintaining the country’s road network.

Presenting the latest quarterly crime statistics for the fourth quarter of 2023/24 and the first quarter of 2024/25 – January to June 2024 – the South African Police Service (SAPS) noted that 10,776 cars were hijacked over the six-month period. This is only a 0.9% decrease compared to the first six months of 2023. However, this equates to approximately 60 cars being stolen daily, which is still a notable concern. This number gets even worse when you include the incidents that go unreported. This was revealed in the latest Victims of Crime (VoC) survey, which looks at crimes through the victim’s experience, including the significant number of crimes that go unreported in South Africa. Surprisingly, the number of hijackings has declined by double-digits, decreasing by 28.9%. However, this decline is from 114,000 incidents to 81,000, meaning the number of hijackings per day decreased from 312 to 222, which is still alarmingly high. According to the SAPS, for the most recent quarter (Q1 2024/25), two provinces experienced a notable year-on-year increase (>10%) in hijackings: the Eastern Cape (30%) and the Western Cape (17%). Interestingly, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Limpopo saw a 12.9% decrease in carjackings, followed by Mpumalanga (-5.2%). Carjackings are most prevalent in South Africa’s most populous regions, such as Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal, and the Western Cape. Over the six months in 2024, Gauteng saw 5,163 hijackings, representing 48% of all carjackings. The Western Cape experienced 1,613 carjackings, and Kwa-Zulu Natal saw 1,512. Looking at more granular station data for Q1 2024/25, the Western Cape has the most hijackings per region, with Nyanga in Cape Town having the most cases. Germiston in Ekurhuleni, Gauteng, had the highest increase in reported cases, rising by 69% compared to last year. Below are the top hijacking hotspots across the most populated provinces for the most recent quarter (April to June). Gauteng: Orange Farms Ivory Park Eldorado Park Pretoria West Germiston Kwa-Zulu Natal: Newlands East Umlazi Western Cape: Nyanga Harare Philippi East Delft Khayelitsha Targeted vehicles Over the course of the past 12 months, Fidelity ADT identified roughly 13 vehicle models that have stood out as hijacking favourites across South Africa. These cars, in no particular order, are: Ford Ranger; Hyundai i20; Nissan Almera Nissan NP200; Toyota Corolla Cross; Toyota Corolla; Toyota Etios; Toyota Fortuner (GD6 and D4D); Toyota Hilux (GD6 and D4D); Toyota Prados; Toyota Land Cruisers; Toyota RAV 4; and VW Polo (especially hatchbacks). While most of these targets are cars that are among the most popular on the roads of South Africa, which are also popular in the rest of Africa, such as the Hilux and Polo, three cars stand out. These are the Nissan Almera, Nissan NP200, and Toyota Etios, all of which have been discontinued in South Africa. The discontinuation of once-popular cars has resulted in a shortage of spare parts, making them a popular target for hijackers. Cartrack, a prominent car-tracking company, agreed and said that the theft of car components has become more widespread than the theft of entire vehicles. It added that the lucrative trade value of illegal chop shops and stolen car parts is estimated at about R442 million. Fidelity ADT’s observations revealed a trend in car thefts targeting popular hatchbacks and bakkies. This trend is also supported by the SAPS’ latest data, which showed that sedans, hatchbacks, and coupes make up 2,511 of the vehicles hijacked, followed by bakkies and panel vans with 1,695 hijackings. These vehicle segments represented 46.2% and 31.2% of all the hijacked cars over the most recent quarter.

Rising interest rates and the overall cost of living have pushed even wealthier consumers to seek cheaper options, triggering a substantial decline in the sales of luxury vehicles. This trend poses a serious challenge for established German brands, as South African buyers are increasingly choosing budget-friendly cars, particularly from Chinese manufacturers. In the first half of 2024, AutoTrader’s data highlighted diverging trends in new and used vehicle sales. While the overall market has seen an uptick in sales of more affordable models, luxury vehicle sales have notably dropped. This shift reflects the financial strain affecting all income levels in South Africa, with even affluent consumers holding back on purchasing high-end vehicles. One of the key drivers of this change is the rise in interest rates, which has made financing new cars significantly more expensive. As a result, many consumers are opting to “buy down,” either by switching to cheaper models or by purchasing used cars. The impact of this trend is most visible in the shrinking market share of luxury brands like BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, whose sales have been steadily declining over the past decade. AutoTrader’s Mid-Year Car Industry Report suggests that this shift is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. It anticipates that demand for more affordable vehicles will continue to grow, putting sustained pressure on luxury brands. The report also points to the growing popularity of Chinese brands and other cost-effective options as a direct response to the financial constraints facing South African consumers. According to the report, 172,668 used cars were sold by the end of June 2024, marking a 2.2% increase compared to the previous year. In contrast, new car sales fell by 6.9% during the same period, with a total of 161,981 passenger cars sold. Within the new car market, South Africans are increasingly turning to budget-friendly alternatives, with Chinese brands and Suzuki seeing a surge in popularity. For the first time, Suzuki made it into the top 10 most-searched-for brands on AutoTrader, replacing luxury brand Porsche, and the Suzuki Swift has emerged as one of the top 10 most-enquired-about models, pushing out the Ford Fiesta. Suzuki Swift This shift in consumer preference is having a profound effect on the sales of traditional luxury brands. Audi, for example, saw its sales drop from 18,375 vehicles in 2014 to just 6,259 in 2023. BMW and Mercedes-Benz have experienced similar declines, with their combined sales more than halving over the same period. The affordability crisis in South Africa has made these brands increasingly out of reach for many consumers. In contrast, Chinese brands are gaining ground rapidly. AutoTrader’s research shows that while many consumers are opting for used vehicles when it comes to Chinese brands, they are more inclined to buy new models. By the end of 2024, it is estimated that Chinese manufacturers will capture around 20% of the new car market in South Africa. Leading the charge among Chinese brands are Haval and Chery, whose sales have skyrocketed in recent years. Data from Naamsa reveals that Haval sold approximately 19,904 units by mid-2024, a dramatic increase from just 872 units in 2019. Chery is expected to report similarly impressive numbers. These brands, along with others like BAIC, Beijing, GWM, Jaecoo, and Omoda, are now driving the growth in South Africa’s affordable car segment. 2024 Haval Jolion Pro. Standard Bank’s vehicle finance division also supports this trend. Data shows that the share of Chinese brands in the bank’s new car financing deals increased from just over 6% in 2022 to 7.4% in the first half of 2024. This growth is even more significant considering the broader decline in new car sales across the country. GWM Haval remains the most popular Chinese brand financed by Standard Bank, followed by Chery and BAIC. These brands have gained the most traction in Gauteng, which accounted for 54% of all Chinese car financing deals, while KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape are also contributing to their growing popularity. The used car market for Chinese brands is expanding as well. The proportion of used Chinese cars financed by Standard Bank rose from 20% in 2022 to 36% by July 2024. Overall, used cars account for 70% of Standard Bank’s vehicle finance deals, reflecting a broader shift toward more affordable options as consumers shy away from expensive new vehicles. This trend is part of a broader global shift toward Chinese automotive brands, driven by competitive pricing and growing consumer confidence in their quality. The popularity of Chinese brands like GWM Haval is evident in Naamsa’s Vehicle Sales by Manufacturer list, where these brands consistently rank among the top ten. In stark contrast, luxury German brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz have fallen out of the top ten most popular car brands in South Africa. BMW, which ranked eighth in 2009, dropped out of the top ten by 2019, and Mercedes-Benz, once ranked sixth, fell out in 2020. Overall, sales of Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz have plummeted by 63.5% over the past decade, with total sales dropping from 71,889 units in 2014 to just 26,202 in 2023. This decline reflects the mounting challenges these brands face as South African consumers increasingly favour affordable Chinese alternatives.

It is located on a 150-hectare site 13 km northeast of Durbanville. It is, therefore, ideally situated to serve the Cape Town aviation sector. The airport has a proud history. It was built in 1943 to serve as an operational base for the South African Air Force. It featured four runways and was home to Lockheed Ventura bombers during the tumultuous era of World War 2. It was previously known as the Fisantekraal Airfield and belonged to the South African Air Force. However, it became privately owned in 1993. In November 2020, private investors acquired the Cape Winelands Airport property. It is owned and operated by RSA.Aero. Currently, Cape Winelands Airport serves as a general aviation facility and is a popular choice for flight training in the Cape Town vicinity. These institutions use the airport for circuit and emergency response training. Private and corporate aircraft occasionally use it for passenger transport. However, big plans are afoot to transform the Cape Winelands Airport into a hub for air travel to Cape Town. The airport has previously unveiled a R7 billion redevelopment and expansion plan to create an international commercial airport. The first step is to expand and realign the primary runway to 3,500 m. The airport currently has four runways, two inactive and the others 700 m and 900 m long. They also plan to build a passenger terminal that can accommodate 5.2 million annual passengers, with the core goal of establishing a cohesive link with Cape Town. More than just another airport The developers aim for the airport to be more than just an aviation hub. It will be used as a driver of regional economic development and local community inclusion. Other developments on this site include cargo terminals, aircraft hangars, a hotel, heliport, warehousing and logistics facilities. A commercial real estate development is also planned. “We are eagerly anticipating our future role in the city’s dynamic travel and tourism landscape,” the Cape Winelands Airport said. Construction on expanding the airport is expected to start early next year, provided all of the approvals are in place. It is currently undergoing numerous legislative processes. “If all our applications are approved, we will begin transforming the airport by realigning the runway, adding new airside infrastructure, and constructing a boutique terminal,” it said. The goal is to commission the transformed airport and open it to local and international flights in 2027. On 8 August 2024, Cape Winelands Airport announced that its environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the proposed airport expansion was underway. This assessment evaluates the potential impact of the airport expansion and the development in the area. The Cape Winelands Airport said it is committed to sustainability trends with eco-friendly practices and technologies. This includes using groundwater resources, powering operations through renewable energy, and having an eco-friendly design. Big benefit to international airlines A significant benefit of the Cape Winelands Airport is that it can serve as an alternative destination for international airlines. The European Union Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) and other regulators require airlines to carry destination alternate fuel. This is the amount of fuel required for an aeroplane to land at an alternative airport if a landing at the destination airport is not possible. For many large airlines, the alternative airport to Cape Town International Airport (CTIA) is O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. That means they must carry a large amount of extra fuel to abide by the aviation rules related to alternative destinations. The Cape Winelands Airport can replace O.R. Tambo as the airlines’ alternative destination, cutting down significantly on the extra fuel they need to carry. The airport explained that its proximity to (CTIA) offers airlines a more viable alternate airport for diversion planning. In turn, it alleviates the need to carry an excessive amount of additional fuel for long-haul flights to satisfy regulations. Cape Winelands Airport will reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by reducing the fuel burden by up to 10,000 kg per flight. Independent estimates suggest that the airport will collectively save airlines millions of kilograms of fuel and boost cargo-carrying capabilities. This is not the only benefit. It will also provide additional capacity, improve redundancy, and reduce inefficiencies at Cape Town International Airport. The increased competition will also result in more affordable and accessible air travel and make travelling to Cape Town more convenient. Parallels have been drawn between the Cape Winelands Airport and the privately owned Lanseria in Johannesburg. RSA.Aero MD Nick Ferguson told Engineering News that their plans are indeed to create an airport similar to Lanseria in Cape Town. However, he said the Cape Winelands Airport will have a longer runway that can accommodate wide-body aeroplanes. “It will be able to handle more international traffic, from more destinations, compared with Lanseria,” he said.

In February 2024, RSA.Aero announced that it had won the tender to upgrade the Plettenberg Bay Airport tender. The agreement with the Bitou Municipality includes leasing, developing, and operating the current Plettenberg Bay Airport. RSA.Aero will provide the funding to upgrade essential airport structures. It includes a new passenger terminal and extended runway. The upgrades will further include an expanded apron and upgraded fire, rescue and emergency service. The upgraded Plettenberg Bay Airport will adhere to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) category 6 standards. ICAO Category 6 refers to a specific classification for airports based on the aircraft size they can handle. It includes aircraft like an Airbus A318, Airbus A319, and Boeing 737-300. Airports in this category need adequate rescue and firefighting (ARFF) resources to handle aircraft of this size. This includes having the needed equipment and personnel to respond effectively to emergencies involving these types of aircraft. Other infrastructure advancements at the upgraded Plettenberg Bay Airport include a new car park, service station and additional aircraft hangars. The Knysna-Plett Herald reported that a zone-based development approach has been adopted to upgrade the airport. The master plan, presented by RSA.Aero, creates seven zones to optimise the space. A new terminal precinct. A temporary terminal. A private and recreational aviation precinct. A corporate aviation and logistics precinct. A solar farm phase one and two. A wastewater treatment and attenuation dam. This will provide much-needed infrastructure to unlock the latent demand for air services in the area. In July 2024, Garden Route Aero (GRA), a subsidiary of RSA.Aero, has started a handover process with the Bitou Municipality for the management of the Plettenberg Bay Airport. The transition process includes numerous airport-related activities, including contractual reviews, operational planning, and civil infrastructure audits. Plett Airport agreement signing One of the main issues is the state of the runway. The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) has raised observations of structural deterioration in the runway. Pavement specialists must conduct a detailed assessment of the pavement infrastructure and confirm what remedial work is required on the runway. Although much work is needed to upgrade the airport, Bitou municipal manager Mbulelo Memani said the partnership will greatly benefit the region. Plettenberg Bay is one of the most sought-after towns among rich South Africans, and better air travel to the region will significantly enhance its appeal and economy. However, scheduled services to Plettenberg Bay have been provided intermittently, constraining growth over the years. Plett airport runway inspection The airport currently processes approximately 30,000 passengers per year. It is expected to increase to 150,000 passengers by 2050 if the airport is upgraded to industry standards. Nick Ferguson, managing director of RSA.aero, said an improved airport would serve a large portion of the Garden Route market in Plettenberg Bay and Knysna. He said safety, efficiency, and predictability are key to successful airport operations. This will be their immediate priority. “We take our responsibility very seriously and will collaborate with all key stakeholders. Our goal is to co-create, partner, and ensure the airport’s success,” said Ferguson. The Bitou municipality said its partnership with RSA.Aero is poised to bring about transformative changes and propel the tourism sector in the region. “The Plettenberg Bay Airport plays a crucial role in our marketing efforts at Plett Tourism. We sell direct access to our domestic and international travellers regularly,” it said.

The new Swift has already been sold in major markets, including Japan, India, and Europe. The South African introduction is scheduled for Spring 2024, with five model variants in the line-up. “The Suzuki Swift introduced South Africans to the Suzuki brand in 2008, and it has since found over 85,000 homes here,” said Brendon Carpenter, Brand Marketing Manager of Suzuki Auto South Africa. “Today, the Swift often leads its segment and even the passenger vehicle market in general. We know that fans at FOM and in the market in general are excited about this fourth-generation model.” The new Swift has several upgrades in the drivetrain, such as a smooth and frugal new CVT transmission option), suspension, chassis and steering and interior design. The new Swift will be available at three specification levels – the GL, GL+, and GLX models. The GL and GLX specification levels will also be available with the choice of manual or CVT transmission. Regarding upgrades, the new Swift has a brand-new rim design that starts at 14” steel wheels on the GL model and grows to 15” alloy wheels on the mid-range GL+ and polished, diamond-cut alloys on the top-spec GLX. Their halogen headlight clusters can also identify the GL and GL+, while the GLX models will upgrade their front light cluster, DRLs and fog lamps to automatic LEDs. All models have LED clusters and a high-level brake lamp at the rear. Fans of the Swift will also notice that the new Swift has four ‘traditional’ door handles instead of the rear side-latch handles that were integrated into the C-pillar of the previous model. “The new model introduces a new 3-cylinder engine, codenamed Z12E, in South Africa. This model uses many of the technologies that Suzuki has refined for its compact vehicles and motorcycles for better thermal management, more low-down torque and better fuel efficiency,” said Suzuki. “With this new 3-cylinder 1.2 litre engine the Swift delivers 60 kW at 5 700 rpm and 112 Nm at 4 300 rpm. The latter is available across a wider engine range, thanks partly to a new multipoint fuel injection system and four valves per cylinder.” “The new engine delivers its power to the front wheels through a five-speed manual or CVT transmission. The former has an Engine Auto Stop/Start system as standard, while the latter offers paddle shifts on the GLX model.” In terms of safety, all models will have six airbags, hill hold control, ABS with emergency brake support and electronic stability control as standard. The new Swift has fitted three-point seatbelts on all five seats and child seat tether anchorage points on the two rear seats outside. The mid-range GL+ will have a host of additional luxuries, such as a 7” infotainment system with reverse camera and steering wheel controls for the audio system.

Central to their success is their focus on affordability and value for money, key factors that are resonating with South African consumers amid challenging economic conditions. In the first quarter of 2024, new vehicle sales in South Africa declined by 5.6% compared to the same period in 2023, although there was a slight 0.2% increase from the previous quarter. Various industry experts attribute this decline to high interest rates, escalating fuel costs, and other economic pressures. As a result, household finances have come under immense strain, with many South Africans struggling to keep up. The DebtBusters Debt Index for the second quarter of 2024 reveals that the median debt-to-income ratio has remained high, stable at 105% for four consecutive quarters. In comparison to 2016, consumers who applied for debt counselling in the second quarter of 2024 had 44% less purchasing power. In this tough economic climate, many car buyers are opting for cheaper vehicles that offer greater value for money. This shift in consumer behaviour has opened the door for Chinese carmakers to thrive, as they provide an affordable alternative to the more expensive premium vehicles. Chinese brands are tapping into this demand for more budget-friendly options, and the results speak for themselves. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), consumers are increasingly turning to Asian car brands, especially those from China, to save money. As of August 2024, 13 Chinese manufacturers are offering 34 different vehicle models in the South African market, including hatchbacks, sedans, crossovers, bakkies, and SUVs. This growing presence has been fueled by popular brands like BAIC, Beijing, Chery, GWM, Haval, Jaecoo, and Omoda, all of which have capitalised on the buying-down trend. The latest Chinese crossover to launch in South Africa—GAC GS3 Emzoom. Over the past four years, the number of Chinese vehicles sold in South Africa has surged dramatically. In 2020, Chinese carmakers sold 7,611 vehicles, a figure that skyrocketed to 30,850 by 2023—a staggering 305% increase. Haval and Chery have been leading the charge in this surge. According to data from Naamsa, Haval sold approximately 19,904 units in 2023, representing a massive increase of over 2,000% from the 872 units sold in 2019. Chery’s sales figures are likely in the same range, further highlighting the success of Chinese brands. Suzuki, another Asian brand, has also enjoyed significant growth. Over the past decade, sales of Suzuki vehicles in South Africa increased from 6,402 to 47,201—a 637% rise. This further illustrates the trend of South African consumers seeking more affordable options as they downsize from premium brands. The shift away from premium vehicles has been particularly stark. Sales of luxury brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW have more than halved over the past decade. In 2014, these brands sold a combined total of 71,889 vehicles, but by 2023, that number had plummeted to just 26,202—a sharp 63.5% decline. Data from Lightstone shows that between 2022 and 2023, sales of Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo dropped by 6.6%, reflecting the broader trend of economic strain on the car market. Audi’s sales, for example, fell from 18,375 units in 2014 to just 6,259 in 2023. Alarmingly, year-to-date sales for these German car brands in 2024 show a further drop of over 10% compared to the same period in 2023. Chinese automakers have not only taken advantage of this shift in consumer demand but have also managed to surpass some long-established brands. Omoda and Jaecoo, two Chinese brands that made their debut in South Africa in 2023 and 2024, have already made a significant impact. Omoda’s C5 crossover, introduced in April 2023, and Jaecoo’s J7 SUV, which followed a year later, are the only models available from their respective brands. However, both brands are planning to expand their product lineups with additional models, such as the Omoda C9 and E5 and the Jaecoo J6 and J8. Despite being new to the market, Omoda and Jaecoo have already seen impressive sales. In July 2024, Omoda sold 224 C5 units, while Jaecoo sold 198 J7 units. Jaecoo J7 This brought their combined total to 422 units for the month, placing them 16th in South Africa’s auto market. Remarkably, in just seven months, these two brands have managed to surpass nine other brands that have been in the country for much longer, including Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Honda, Volvo, Porsche, and Subaru. As South African consumers continue to face economic challenges, more are choosing to downscale and opt for cheaper, reliable vehicles. Chinese automakers have stepped in to fill this gap, offering a wide range of budget-friendly options that appeal to a growing segment of the market. With their expanding presence and growing sales figures, Chinese car brands are well-positioned to continue their upward trajectory in South Africa.

FNB said that the domestic automotive industry accounts for roughly 5.3% of GDP, with 3.2% coming from manufacturing and 2.1% from retail. The manufacturing segment alone employs roughly 125,222 workers, which rises to over 400,000 jobs when the entire value chain is considered. The industry is thus a crucial indicator of economic health. However, it has faced several challenges in recent years, such as load shedding and weakened demand arising from the cost-of-living crisis. Although total new vehicle sales increased modestly by 1.5% in July, overall volumes have been under pressure, showing a year-on-year decline since August 2023 due to weak local demand. Year-to-date (YTD) total sales volumes declined by 6.2%, while new passenger vehicles declined by 5.0% and new commercial vehicles by 8.4%. “While the YTD decline in commercial vehicles may reflect a correction following robust growth last year, the weakness in passenger vehicles underscores significantly weak consumer fundamentals,” said FNB. “The rise in interest rates—from a low of 3.50% at the peak of the pandemic to 8.25% currently—has materially impacted consumer balance sheets and affordability.” “Additionally, vehicle pricing, influenced by factors such as the rand exchange rate’s performance, has further eroded consumer affordability for new vehicles.” Thus, consumers are holding onto their cars for longer or increasingly participating in the used-car market. Used car boom Stats SA data shows that real motor trade sales for used cars increased by 3.0%, but sales for new vehicles dropped by 9.7%. In addition, the National Traffic Information System (NATIS) showed that the number of used vehicle registrations rose by 4.8% in the first six months of 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. “While used vehicles are generally more expensive than before the pandemic, the notable moderation in inflation should assist in underpinning consumer preference for used vehicles,” said FNB. Domestic motor vehicle production has experienced a modest decline, dropping by 3.0% YTD in response to weak demand and a normalisation from the robust growth seen post-pandemic. Other automotive segments are also under pressure. Production of bodies for motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers is down by 9.1%, while the production of parts and accessories is down by 17.8%. The external trade balance also highlights the general weakness in the domestic automotive sector, with the nominal rand value of imported vehicles down by 23.3% in the first six months of 2024, compared to the major 39.0% increase seen in 1H23. “Overall, while the domestic automotive sector is experiencing cyclical weakness, particularly due to weak demand, part of this downturn can be attributed to a correction following the solid post-pandemic performance,” said FNB. “Cost-of-living pressures, including rising vehicle prices, have slightly benefitted the used car market as consumers try to avoid the premium in new vehicle prices.” “However, an impending interest rate cutting cycle, a more stable rand exchange rate, and expected improvements in household disposable income should provide some support to the automotive sector moving forward.” Read : Interest rate surprise on the cards for South Africa Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

The Hybrid’s intelligent hybrid drive system uses a 78kW (268Nm) electric motor and a 2-litre 180kW (380Nm) petrol engine for a combined output of 255kW of power and a 648Nm of torque.

The speed limit on the 120km section of the highway is double the nation’s standard 120 km/h. According to our sister publication TopAuto , carmakers generally use the 250km/h stretch of highway to test vehicles in hot weather conditions before putting them in production to ensure that they continue to work even in extreme heat. Given the extremely small population in the area, the roads are incredibly are in relatively great condition due to being used sparingly. The highway is thus perfect for testing high-performance vehicles through their paces before handing them over to customers. Road users are also extremely aware of the 120km stretch, with big, yellow signboards station: It’s nearly impossible to miss the 120km stretch; there are big, yellow warning signs posted at the start and end of the road reading. However, in a disappointing blow to car enthusiasts, only cars approved by the relevant authorities with a bright yellow sticker reading “High-Speed Test Vehicle Approved By Government” are allowed to hit 250km/h on the highway. Regular motorists will still be capped at the standard 120km/h. Several well-known manufacturers, including Bugatti, Porsche, and BMW, have tested their models on the stretch of road. South Africa vs the rest of the world Although the 250km/h stretch is double that of the nation’s regular limit, South African officials have previously called for a reduction in the nation’s speed limits. In 2022, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) announced plans to limit maximum speeds, along with several other interventions to reduce fatalities on the country’s roads. South Africa’s regulations are in line with recommendations made by the United Nations to reduce speed by 10km/h, which is biding for South Africa as a member of the United Nation’s roads council. The drop would see the 120km/h speed limit drop to 100km/h, while the residential speed limit of 60km/h would drop to 50km/h. South Africa’s regulators are, however, yet to introduce any new initaivies to reduce speed limits. Despite the push for slower roads, South Africa’s 120km/h highway is broadly in line with many developed nations. Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA all have maximum speed limits of 130km/h, with certain variations applied. Despite state officials recommending a 130km/h speed limit, Germany’s autobahn famously has no federally mandated speed limit.

The skyrocketing prices of new cars have made it difficult for the average South African to afford a vehicle, with less than a quarter of all car models priced under R500,000. Based on TopAuto’s list of cars available in South Africa, it is estimated that there are currently 1,481 car models for sale in the country. This number includes passenger vehicles and excludes medium and heavy commercial vehicles. Of these models, 1,082 now cost over R500,000, representing almost 75% of the new car market – meaning only 25% are priced under the half-a-million rand mark. Experts and stakeholders in the industry have explained the significant increases in car prices as a result of several factors, such as inflation, supply chain disruptions, safety and legal requirements, and changing consumer preferences. The latest TransUnion Vehicle Pricing Index (VPI) shows that while the average price of new vehicles stays just below inflation year-on-year, some body types outstripped CPI in the first quarter of 2024. The index measures the relationship between the increase in vehicle pricing for new and used vehicles from a basket of passenger vehicles incorporating 15 top-volume manufacturers. According to the report, the price of new vehicles increased by 4.7% on average in Q1 2024—just under inflation by 0.5%, which was recorded at 5.2%. The report noted that the price increases in three segments further exceeded CPI. On average, the price of all body types increased over the period, with hatchbacks and crossovers seeing the steepest increases at 8.4% and 6.4%, respectively, in Q1 2024. Other YoY price increases included premium hatchbacks (6.1%), hybrids (5.1%), SUVs (4.2%), and electric vehicles (1.3%). It’s concerning to see that hatchbacks, traditionally the most affordable segment in car brands, have seen the steepest price increases year over year. This trend is largely attributed to the local economy’s poor performance and the volatile rand/US dollar exchange rate, making it substantially more expensive to import and sell vehicles in recent years. Consequently, the availability of affordable cars for those earning at the lower end of the salary spectrum has decreased. As of July 2024, no cars are available for under R180,000, with the sole exception being Suzuki’s S-Presso priced at R178,900 — a situation not seen a few years ago. In Q1 2024, this resulted in the average loan value rising to R391,000, reflecting higher prices and a shift in consumer preferences toward more premium vehicle segments. This algins with data from finance house WesBank, which shows that the average consumer spent R392,174 on a new car in the first quarter of 2024, a noteworthy increase of 24% over the corresponding period in 2019. The increasing car prices have broader implications for South Africa. With fewer affordable options available, South Africans are either forced to purchase used cars, which may come with higher maintenance costs, or take on larger loans for new vehicles, increasing household debt, which seems to be the case. Coinsidering the average financed amounf of R391,000, we looked at all thecars that cost between R380,000 and R400,000 to give you an idea on the cars you can buy aorund this price point.

GNCAP’s crash tech protocols assess frontal and side impact protection for all models, as well as Electronic Stability Control (ESC). However, in the latest #SaferCarsforAfrica testing, all three South African cars that were tested registered incredibly low safety scores. The cars tested were: Maruti Suzuki Ertiga (2 airbags standard) Kia Pegas (2 airbags standard) Renault Triber (2 airbags standard) “We are disappointed to see global brands like Renault, Kia and Maruti Suzuki offer such a low safety performance in markets like South Africa whilst achieving much higher levels of protection in many other global markets,” said Alejandro Furas, Global NCAP Secretary General. “We remain concerned at the low ratings received from the manufacturers, but we are confident they will use these results to improve their safety moving forward,” added Sikkie Kajee, Chairman of the Automobile Association. “Issues with double standards persist regarding vehicles made for Africa, but again, we are assured these matters are being addressed and are confident that in the future, we will see fewer discrepancies than we currently do.” The ratings The India-made Ertiga’s structure was rated as borderline unstable. Its footwell area was rated as unstable and pedal displacement showed injury risks to the lower legs of the driver. That said, the head and neck protection for adults was good, while the chest protection for the passenger was good, even if the driver’s chest protection only received marginal protection. Side impact protection showed good protection for the head, pelvis and abdomen, while there was adequate protection for the chest. Global NCAP said that Ertiga does not even offer side airbags as an option. In addition, the passenger pretensioner failed to work properly. Child occupant protection was poor for the 18-month-old dummy used in the test. The Child Restraint System (CRS) was also installed in the forward-facing position, whilst best practice indicates a rearward-facing position offers better protection for this age group. Side impact child protection, however, was good. “The Ertiga only offers a lap belt in the rear centre position which explains the significant points loss in child occupant protection,” said Global NCAP. “The passenger airbag cannot be disconnected if a rearward-facing CRS is installed in the front seat. The Ertiga offers standard ISOFIX anchorages.” Suzuki hits back at report In response to the report, Suzuki has raised several vital concerns about the testing. It noted that the Ertiga in the test is from 2019 and is an older generation model that does not have any of the safety upgrades that Suzuki has since added. In addition, the group claims that the Ertiga tested was built for Indian customer specifications for the Indian market and was never for sale in South Africa. Suzuki said that the images and videos show the same unique vehicle identifier (OD2119MER1) in the videos for both the #SaferCarsForIndia 2019 and #SaferCarsForAfrica 2024 tests, meaning the 2024 test was not reflective of 2024 standards. Both videos, which can be found below, are also identical. 2024 South Africa Version 2019 Indian Version Suzuki added that the testing protocols used by the GNCAP have changed significantly in the last five years, with the most recent protocols published in 2022. With the GNCAP changes, the Ertiga tested in 2019 received a three-star safety rating for driver and passenger safety. The same information was then considered only worthy of a one-star rating in the recent report without retesting. “By only referring to the year 2024, the report’s authors—perhaps inadvertently—create the impression that all tests were conducted recently and with the same model.” “It is highly possible that the quality and sensitivity of vehicle testing equipment, including the crash test dummies, have improved significantly over the past five years,” said Suzuki “The child restraints used in the two tests are not the same, which may further support the assumption that the dummies used in the two tests were different and the data collected from them incomparable.” Suzuki also questioned how the Ertiga had the highest side impact rating of all the vehicles tested, yet the overall score received was the lowest.

This is according to Greg Cress, the Principal Director of Automotive and eMobility at Accenture in Africa, who believes that adjusting the ad valorem tax could significantly benefit South African consumers and, specifically, the future of electric vehicles (EVs) in South Africa. According to TopAuto’s list of cars available in South Africa, approximately 1,481 car models are currently available for sale in the country. This count includes passenger vehicles and does not include medium and heavy commercial vehicles. Out of these models, around 1,082 are priced at over R500,000, which accounts for almost 75% of the new car market. This means that only 25% of the models are priced below half a million rand. Car prices have risen significantly in recent years due to several factors, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, safety and legal requirements, and evolving consumer preferences. During the Covid-19 pandemic, car manufacturers faced reduced demand, prompting them to increase prices to sustain their businesses. Although consumer spending has since recovered, many companies continue to operate with decreased output as a result of employee layoffs and factory closures. This has led to a supply and demand imbalance for certain goods, like cars and their components such as semiconductors, ultimately causing prices to rise. South African economic conditions exacerbate car import costs due to high taxes, import duties and a weakening rand exchange rate. One of these taxes, while only a small part of the taxes imposed on imported vehicles, is the Ad Valorem Luxury Tax. Surprisingly, according to Cress, this ‘luxury tax’ has not been revised for nearly three decades. This means South Africans are still paying this tax on all cars over R250,000. Thirty years ago, cars over R250,000 could afford luxury brands such as Jaguar, Porsche, and more. 1994 Jaguar XJ-6 AT For example, you could buy a BMW 320i for R106,590, which, in today’s money, would be around R725,000. Similarly, thirty years ago, one could buy a Jaguar XJ-6 AT for R369,505, worth R1,965,017 today if adjusted for inflation. Therefore, a BMW 320i was not considered a “luxury” for the purposes of ad valorem in 1994, while a Jaguar was. Today, only cars considered budget models are below R250,000, with only 14 models under this price currently on the market. Under the current ad valorem tax, a Kia Picanto (starting at R260,995) is considered a “luxury” vehicle. If inflation had been considered for the ad valorem tax today, only goods that cost more than R1,329,493.09 would be taxed as luxury goods. The formula for the ad valorem tax is as follows: % = [(0.00003 * retail value less 20%) – 0.75] The maximum ad valorem tax that can be applied is 30%. At the moment, any vehicle imported above the price of R250,000 will have at least 5.25% added, which equates to a tax of R13,125. 2024 Kia Picanto 1.0 LX Manual Cress argued that updating this tax, along with other notable policy and regulation changes, will play a big role in stimulating the uptake of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in South Africa, considering the global shift to greener fuels. “Adjusting the tax would make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable to a broader audience, thereby stimulating local demand. “Moreover, a temporary removal of import duties on EVs could further boost consumption and prompt manufacturers to consider local production setups,” he said. A recent BuinessTech poll asked 1,615 readers whether they would consider purchasing an electric vehicle. 672 (48%) said they would take the leap when prices come down. Currently, most EVs are priced over R500,000, which limits their market penetration. Cress stressed that targeting a price point of approximately R400,000 or lower is essential to foster local demand and lay the foundation for a thriving EV industry. Achieving a target of more than 5% of new car sales being electric vehicles by 2026—equating to around 30,000 units annually—would mark a significant milestone. He said, “This achievement would catalyze the development of necessary infrastructure, including the widespread deployment of EV charging stations that utilise renewable energy.” Read: Hijackers are targeting 3 discontinued cars in South Africa Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Lifestyle · 59m South Africans can now visit 101 countries visa-free in 2026 – losing access to 5 destinations Business · 1h Financial giant gets the green light to buy South African company for R2.2 billion Government · 2h The top Durban school where 90% of matrics achieved A or B aggregates Motoring · 4h Changes to legal limit when drinking and driving in South Africa Government · 4h Bad news for beer lovers in South Africa Business · 5h End of an era for major international company in South Africa Industry News Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum More News Business · 7h Johann Rupert’s R19 trillion luxury giant is killing it Business Opinion · 7h Eskom holding South Africa hostage Government · 9h Ramaphosa sends a warning to the ANC Government · 9h New state of disaster on the cards for South Africa Business Opinion · 10h In contemplation of Sapiens – the species and the book 5 Things · 10h Prime interest rate ‘cartel’ investigation in South Africa, and South African retail giant in hot water Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

According to data from the South African Police Services (SAPS), there are 66 reported car hijackings every day, marking a significant 34% increase compared to pre-pandemic levels. It’s important to highlight that these statistics only cover hijackings involving violence or coercion against the driver. The data reveals that approximately 10,000 vehicle thefts are reported per quarter, which amounts to about 40,000 thefts annually. Looking back at the first quarter of 2024, Fidelity ADT confirmed that within the Fidelity footprint, the number of hijackings recorded increased compared to the corresponding periods during 2023 and the second half of 2023. Over the course of the past 12 months, the security group have identified roughly 14 vehicle models that have stood out as hijacking favourites across South Africa. These cars, in no particular order, are: BMW 3 Series; Ford Ranger; Hyundai i20; Nissan Almera Nissan NP200; Toyota Corolla Cross; Toyota Corolla; Toyota Etios; Toyota Fortuner (GD6 and D4D); Toyota Hilux (GD6 and D4D); Toyota Prados; Toyota Land Cruisers; Toyota RAV 4; and VW Polo (especially hatchbacks). While most of these targets are cars that are among the most popular on the roads of South Africa, which are also popular in the rest of Africa, such as the Hilux and Polo, three cars stand out. These are the Nissan Almera , Nissan NP200 , and Toyota Etios, all of which have been discontinued in South Africa. Toyota discontinued the Etios in 2020 and replaced it with the Suzuki-sourced Toyota Starlet. The South African automotive market also bid the Nissan Almera farewell in 2023 when the imports from India ended, resulting in Nissan quietly discontinuing this once-popular sedan. Nissan Almera. Toyota Etios The most recent model to be axed from showroom floors is the NP200. Although the compact bakkie was officially discontinued in April 2024, it remained one of the most stolen vehicles in the country in the first half of this year. Commenting on the reasons for the targeted cars, Fidelity ADT noted that the “business” of stolen cars is largely driven by supply and demand, which includes their parts. Cartrack, a prominent car-tracking company, agreed and said that the theft of car components has become more widespread than the theft of entire vehicles. They mentioned that the high demand for affordable, readily available parts on the black market drives this trend, as these parts are easier to conceal and harder to trace than whole cars. This is due to experienced syndicates with designated chop shops being able to dismantle any car in minutes. Cartrack has observed just how easy it is for criminals to steal vehicle components. They noted that four wheels can be removed in five minutes, airbags and tailgates in two minutes, and a battery disconnected in as little as one minute. The company reported that airbags, batteries, tailgates, wheels, and tyres are among the most stolen parts. Cartrack also reported incidents of stolen vehicles later found completely stripped, showing the lucrative trade value of illegal chop shops and stolen car parts, estimated at about R442 million. This unlawful practice is viewed as a quicker and more profitable alternative to reselling stolen vehicles. The discontinuation of once-popular cars has resulted in a shortage of spare parts, making them a popular target for hijackers. Tracker has commented on the latest hijacking hotspots, stating that while shopping malls are still a primary hotspot for theft in South Africa, their data also shows that sporting and school events are primary hunting grounds for hijackings and car thefts across the country.

Jetour Auto was launched by the Chery Holding Group in 2018 in response to market trends and consumer demand for vehicles that combine innovative design, advanced technology, and affordability. Since its inception, Jetour Auto has operated independently in the global market, with dedicated R&D, manufacturing facilities, sales, and after-sales channels. It will also operate independently in the South African market. Over the last five years alone, Jetour has sold over 1,180,000 vehicles globally across its five product lines, partnering with over 1,200 companies in more than 60 countries and regions worldwide, achieving a number-one position in several markets. Johnny Fang, Managing Director of Jetour in South Africa, stated that the company aims to sell 800 units monthly in the first year of operation. The Jetour X70 Plus and Dashing models will be the first to be introduced in the local market. He emphasised that local priorities include enhancing service quality and ensuring the availability of parts. The company has already established a parts warehouse in Kyalami, which covers 4,000 square meters and can house up to 82,000 parts. This will enable customers to access the required parts efficiently and reliably. “Jetour, with over 27 years of global experience and 26,000 patents, aims to manufacture safer, more comfortable, intelligent, and eco-conscious automobiles by integrating extensive data analytics and advanced manufacturing equipment,” it said. Fang expressed excitement about replicating Jetour’s global success in South Africa and becoming the top choice for travel vehicles among local customers. Jetour Dashing What to expect The Jetour Dashing showcases a contemporary design with striking angles, elegant lights, and a spacious grille. It is 4,590mm in length, 1,900mm in width, and 1,685mm in height. Depending on the region, the Dashing is equipped with either a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine generating 115kW and 230Nm or a 1.6-litre engine producing 145kW and 290Nm. The smaller engine is available with both six-speed manual and automatic transmissions, while the larger engine is paired with a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. On a global scale, the SUV features advanced options such as intelligent LED lights, a panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and start, a 15.6-inch infotainment system, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated seats, 40W wireless chargers, and a comprehensive set of driver assistance systems. Jetour X70 Plus The X70 Plus is targeted toward family-oriented buyers as it is available in both five and seven-seater configurations. It is notably longer than its counterpart, measuring 4,749mm in length, equally wide at 1,900mm, and slightly taller at 1,720mm. The X70 Plus is equipped with the same 1.5-litre and 1.6-litre powertrains as the Dashing. Inside, it features leather trim, heated and ventilated front seats with electric adjustment, a fully digital driver’s display, a 10.25-inch media hub, digital climate control, a panoramic sunroof, seven-color ambient lighting, and a wireless charger.

According to the latest PwC Voice of the Consumer Survey, three out of four respondents indicated an appetite to buy a hybrid or electric vehicle. Local sales of these vehicles increased by 65% in 2023, and they are expected to rise again by 30% in 2024. The rising cost of internal combustion engine (ICE) transport and the declining price entry point of electric vehicles (EVs) supported this growth. This is certainly supporting the increase in EV sales in 2024. The most affordable full-sized EV in South Africa costs roughly R540,000 – down from the R690,000 seen in 2022-2023. “Some South African consumers are interested in EVs due to environmental considerations and the contribution these could make to reduce climate change,” said PwC. “The country has in recent years seen an increase in the frequency and impact of extreme weather events. Nine out of ten survey respondents are worried about climate change, with over a third of them feeling worried on a daily basis.” “This worry stems partially from the impact climate change could have on South Africans through income (jobs) and wealth (savings) effects via the business world, among other channels.” That said, PwC admitted that the reported appetite for EV and hybrid ownership is often overstated on surveys when compared to actual purchasing intentions. “It is easy to say that you would want to own an EV, while the realities of constrained supply, charging challenges (load shedding), range anxiety (the fear that an EV will run out of battery before reaching a charger or destination), and initial purchase cost most often outweigh this interest in favour of ICE vehicles.” While EV sales have increased significantly over the past several years, they still only comprise roughly 0.2% of total vehicle sales. The falling price of EVs and the increasing cost of ICE vehicles should swing the pendulum in the other direction. As previously noted, South African consumers are increasingly worried about climate change, with over a third worrying about it on a daily basis. “Some are aware that, in January 2024, the world witnessed the first year-long breach of the 1.5°C warming limit with the average near-surface global temperature surging to more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for a consecutive 365-day period,” said PwC. With greater concern over climate change and its impact, a growing number of consumers are willing to change their consumption habits and buy products with smaller environmental impacts. 39% of South Africans listed extreme weather conditions in their top three threats/risks for the country in the next 12 months – on par with the response rate with concerns over macroeconomic volatility and health risks. South Africa has already seen an increase in the frequency and impact of extreme weather events, with extreme rains and flooding the most common. The Western Cape, for instance, was declared a disaster zone in mid-July amid intense rainstorms, with schools being forced to close for two days in the province.

In a case before the Ombudsman for Short-term Insurance, the insured submitted a claim for vehicle damage after they collided with a cow. The insurer rejected the claim on the basis that the insured failed to apply reasonable care and precaution to prevent the incident. In the complaint, the insured did not dispute the speed at which he travelled, stating that he was not aware of the speed limit applicable to the road. The insured added that the speed was irrelevant as he could not see the due to a third-party vehicle travelling in the opposite direction, blinding his vision with its lights—meaning he could not see the cow. The insurer acquired the services of an independent expert who retrieved the vehicle’s speed from the diagnostic data of the vehicle, and consider the circumstances surrounding the accident. The insurer provided evidence to show that the insured vehicle was travelling 130km/h when the incident took place. The insurer also highlighted the following information: The road was poorly lit. There was a sign 13 km before the collision confirming the maximum speed to be travelled on the road as 80 km/h. There was a sign on the opposite direction warning of the prevalence of cows on the road. The road was travelled earlier in the day by the insured, and he was, therefore, familiar with the road and the applicable road restrictions. The independent expert appointed by the insurer added the following: “The risk vehicle was travelling a maximum speed of between 125 km/h and 135 km/h within 5 seconds before the crash, and this is between 56% and 69% faster than the speed limit for the road. “The driver increased the stopping distance by approximately 58 meters by driving at 130 km/h. “By doing that, an inescapable emergency was created by the driver’s own tortious conduct. When a driver engages in an activity in which certain emergencies are likely to arise, the driver must be prepared to meet them.” “Had the incident driver opted to travel at the speed limit or appropriate speed, then he would have been in a better position to observe animals, reduce the vehicle speed and take evasive action or bring the vehicle to a complete stop.” With these facts, the insurer rejected the liability for the claim on the basis that the insured failed to apply the necessary due care. Since it was clear that the insured travelled over the speed limit, the OSTI had to determine if the insured’s actions could be considered a failure to apply the necessary due care and precaution. “The issue to be determined was whether the insurer had shown, on a balance of probability, that the insured’s conduct was reckless ,” said Nekecia van Niekerk, Assistant Ombudsman. The insurer has to prove that the insured intentionally disregarded the maximum speed limit. It then had to show that the incident would not have occurred if the vehicle had travelled at the right speed. Drinking and driving in South Africa – what insured South Africans need to know Findings The OSTI said that there were several aspects left wanting in the insurer’s case, stating that the accident only occurred due to the speed travelled without evidence. It was undisputed that the insured was blinded by an oncoming vehicle and did not see the animal. Moreover, the road sign warning of the presence of animals was only present on the oncoming lane, meaning it could not be considered relevant to the insured. In addition, it was argued that the insured could not have been familiar with the road after only having travelled on it once before the collision. The insurer could also not speak to the position, speed or visibility of the animal. “Based on the undisputed facts, it would have been impossible to predict the movement of the animal or for the driver to foresee the presence of an animal on the road,” said Van Niekerk. “OSTI found that it was essential for the insurer to take cognisance of the fact that there were several intervening factors at play and that it would be unreasonable to say that by merely driving slower, the animal would have been visible, and the collision would subsequently have been avoided.” Moreover, the OSTI questioned the insurer’s experts, as the diagnostic did not record a reaction manoeuvre, and little data was available for the expert to calculate distances accurately. “OSTI reminded the insurer that the opinion of an expert does not automatically deem a claim accurately rejected, and excessive speed does not inevitably amount to recklessness.” “Each matter is to be considered in its own set of facts for it to be determined whether it is reasonable to deny liability.” “An insurer cannot merely reject a claim without providing proof that the actions of the driver are material to the loss.” “OSTI found that the insurer had not discharged its onus on a balance of probability, and a recommendation to pay the claim was issued. The insurer conceded to OSTI’s recommendation and settled the claim.” Read : Two sectors to blame for keeping South Africa on the grey list – now fines and sanctions are coming Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Lifestyle · 11h Unique South African school achieves 100% university exemption and 4.4 distinctions per student Energy · 12h South Africans to pay for R76 billion mistake Government · 13h Dark times ahead for an important South African industry Finance · 14h Tax return warning for over 500,000 taxpayers in South Africa Business · 16h R17 billion boost for South African-born billionaire since the start of 2026 Government · 17h Europe gives South Africa the green light Industry News Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech More News Business · 19h Tax disaster for one of South Africa’s major employers 5 Things · 20h South Africans must still use Post Office for parcels under 1kg, and SAPS in deep trouble Business · 21h Store cheaper than Checkers and Pick n Pay launches nationwide delivery Lifestyle · 13 Jan 2026 South Africa’s top-performing private school with 4.3 distinctions per matriculant Government · 13 Jan 2026 AGOA hope for South Africa Lifestyle · 13 Jan 2026 25-year-old foreigners are retiring in South Africa Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

The index measures the relationship between the increase in vehicle pricing for new and used vehicles from a basket of passenger vehicles incorporating 15 top-volume manufacturers. According to the report, the price of new vehicles increased by 4.7% on average in Q1 2024—just under inflation by 0.5%, which was recorded at 5.2%. The report noted that the price increases in three segments further exceeded CPI. On average, the price of all body types increased over the period, with hatchbacks and crossovers seeing the steepest increases at 8.4% and 6.4%, respectively, in Q1 2024. Other YoY price increases included premium hatchbacks (6.1%), hybrids (5.1%), SUVs (4.2%), and Electric (1.3%). It’s concerning to see that hatchbacks, traditionally the most affordable segment in car brands, have seen the steepest price increases year over year. This trend is largely attributed to the local economy’s poor performance and the volatile rand/US dollar exchange rate, making it substantially more expensive to import and sell vehicles in recent years. Consequently, the availability of affordable cars for those earning at the lower end of the salary spectrum has decreased. As of July 2024, no cars are available for under R180,000, with the sole exception being Suzuki’s S-Presso priced at R178,900 — a situation not seen a few years ago. Throughout 2023 and 2024, motorists have faced the challenge of increasingly expensive cars, a result of both national and international factors like inflation, and shortages of chips and other auto parts, which have impacted the industry throughout this year. What you can afford Industry experts still recommend that prospective buyers shouldn’t spend more than a quarter (25%) of their monthly income on vehicle-related costs. So, if you earn R20,000 per month, your total vehicle expenses should not exceed R5,000. And this should apply to the whole vehicle expense, including: Vehicle instalments Insurance premiums Fuel costs Below, BusinessTech looked at what you can afford to buy on your monthly salary in South Africa, using the above assumption that people will not spend more than 25% of their gross monthly income on vehicle financing. The calculations were made using Wesbank’s repayments calculator and include the assumption of a 0% deposit for car financing. They also exclude any additional fees incurred during the loan’s inception into the calculation. Finally, the cars are financed over five years (60 months) at an annual interest rate of 11.75%. This follows the South African Reserve Bank’s recent decision to hold rates in July. These calculations are purely for comparison purposes and are not meant as financial advice.

Looking at the top ten vehicle brands in the country over the past 15 years, the group highlighted that a few new brands have broken into the top reaches thanks to a high number of sales, while other brands have fallen out of favour. Notably, Renault and Kia have broken into the top ten in recent years and have remained some of the most popular brands. BMW and Mercedes Benz, however, have dropped out of South Africa’s top ten car brands. “As the quality of the more affordable vehicles continues to improve, these brand shifts could become permanent,” Lightstone said. Toyota and Volkswagen remain the country’s favourite brands and have maintained the top positions for 15 years. Suzuki “came from nowhere” in 2018 to claim the third spot in 2022, nudging Hyundai back to fourth place, just a year after the South Korean brand moved to third. Renault shot into the top ten in 2014 and is now in the seventh spot. Kia debuted in the top ten in 2016 and is now eighth. Other new entrants include Chery and Haval. These brands are among the more affordable vehicles from China and South Korea, the analytics group noted. BMW, which was the eighth most popular vehicle brand in South Africa by sales in 2009, dropped out of the top ten in 2019. Mercedes-Benz, which was the sixth most popular brand in 2009, dropped out in 2020. Another popular premium brand, Audi, has only ever been in tenth position but fell out of the list in 2014. According to Lightstone, the market shifts reflect tough economic conditions, which have dampened consumer spending and led to lifestyle changes. Consumers have had to adapt to the changing landscape—and this has been done by pricing down. Lighstone noted that South Africa’s total new vehicle sales of 393,405 in 2009, just after the financial markets crash, were the second-lowest recorded in the past 15 years, marginally ahead of the 389,205 sales in 2020, the year COVID-19 wreaked havoc. While the market did recover after 2009, to above 600,000 sales a year between 2012-2015, consumer appetite softened ahead of the pandemic, drifting down to 536,604 in 2019. “Today, sales have recovered to around the same territory (531,787 in 2023) and any further upward mobility will depend on an improving domestic economy. “All signs indicate that there will be some small interest rate relief from the South African Reserve Bank this year, although government policy may shift as the country adapts to the 2024 election results. “Until things change, we can expect to see consumers continue to be under pressure and most likely continue to price down,” it said. Rise of the Chinese National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) has noted a trend of consumers downsizing and turning to the growing number of Asian participants—particularly Chinese brands—which are making a significant impact in the market. The buying-down trend can be seen in the strong growth of sales from cheaper brands such as Suzuki and popular Chinese brands, including BAIC, Beijing, Chery, GWM, Haval, Jaecoo, and Omoda. Over the last four years alone, the cars listed above (with many only entering the market within the last couple of years) increased sales from 7,611 in 2020 to 30,850 as of 2023—a 305% increase. Haval and Chery have been the main drivers of this trend. Naamsa’s data shows that Havel has sold approximately 19,904 units, representing an increase of over 2,000% from the 872 recorded in 2019. Chery’s sales are likely to be in the same region. Suzuki has also been a notable participant, having seen immense growth in the past decade. Sales of its vehicles grew from 6,402 to 47,201—a 637% increase.

The South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB’s) Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep rates unchanged in May, maintaining the repo rate at 8.25% and the prime lending rate at 11.75%. Economists anticipate that the SARB will maintain the rates at 8.25% when the Monetary Policy Committee convenes in July. They are hopeful that interest rate cuts will be postponed until the September meeting. Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop, however, is more cautious about predicting a rate cut in September, instead suggesting a more moderate cut in November or possibly in January 2025. Looking ahead, the Bank of America (BofA) expects 25 basis point cuts to begin in January 2025, followed by cumulative cuts of 100 basis points in January, March, May, and July. This projection is in line with momentum, which also foresees a 100 basis point cut by mid-2025. Despite this, Investec predicts that the cutting cycle will conclude after a 150 basis point reduction, possibly around the middle of 2025 at the July meeting (with a repo rate of 6.75%). Investec’s forecast is outlined below: Meeting Move Rate May 2024 Hold 8.25% July 2024 Hold 8.25% September 2024 Hold 8.25% November 2024 -25 bps 8.00% January 2025 -50 bps 7.50% March 2025 -25 bps 7.25% May 2025 -25 bps 7.00% July 2025 -25 bps 6.75% September 2025 Hold 6.75% This maximum forecast of 150bps will bring much-needed relief for car owners with loans in South Africa, and it’s expected to commence as soon as November. Interest rates have remained unchanged since the last policy rate decision a year ago, adding to the financial strain on households that have also faced other cost increases, such as electricity, fuel, and property rates. According to WesBank, t he average amount for a new vehicle financed through their institution was approximately R410,000. This means that individuals who purchased a car at this value and secured a loan at current rates will pay R270 less per month on their repayments at a forecasted prime rate of 10.25% by July 2025. However, this saving diminishes as the price of the car increases. For instance, those who bought an R500,000 car will pay R375 less per month, while those who purchased a R1 million car will enjoy a more substantial reduction of R750 per month. The table below highlights how much you’ll save on your bond every month if the forecasted 150 bps interest rate cuts come into effect next year.

Year-to-date, new vehicle sales have declined 7.4% to 246,052 units, leaving the possibility that the market will fail to reach 500,000 units this year. “Vehicle price inflation, high interest rates, and the general rising costs of living are all impacting the ability of new car buyers to enter or stay in the market,” said Lebo Gaoaketse, Head of Marketing and Communication at WesBank. “Until there is some relief in interest rates, greater incentive deals from manufacturers, or a significant shift in general inflation or earnings, the new vehicle market will continue to remain under pressure,” he added. In the automotive industry, the impact of lower interest rates cannot be overstated. This financial shift would encourage consumers to make significant purchases, ultimately driving up sales and providing crucial support to businesses throughout the supply chain. The implications wouldn’t just stop at the property and car sales sectors. A noteworthy reduction in interest rates would have extensive positive ramifications for the broader economy. The resulting surge in consumer spending would lead to a noticeable uptick in demand, thereby triggering heightened production levels, facilitating job creation, and fostering a more robust economic outlook.

In the 2023 annual report for the Ombudsman for Short-Term Insurance (OSTI), Assistant Ombudsman Zanele Makamba examined a case in which the insured submitted a claim for damage sustained to his vehicle following an accident. However, the insurer rejected the claim, arguing that the driver was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. Although the driver admitted that he had four beers at his girlfriend’s party between 09h00 and 15h00, the accident took place at 19h48 (almost 5 hours later) after he avoided a pedestrian on the road, veered into an embankment and hit a tree. The insurer’s assessment confirmed the facts leading up to the accident, where he said that he was sober and that the alcohol did not have any influence on his driving ability . Alcohol is mainly broken down by the liver, which can metabolise roughly one standard drink per hour, but this also depends on age, weight, gender and food eaten. While alcohol can stay in the system between 6 and 72 hours, the half-life is roughly 4 to 5 hours. Most men with minimal to no tolerance will start to show characteristics of intoxication when their blood alcohol content (BAC) reaches 0.05%. Their ability to drive will be significantly impaired at 0.07%. The insurer rejected the claim, arguing that the driver was under the influence of alcohol, with the decision heading to the OTSI. The issue for determination in the matter was whether the insured was, on the balance of probabilities, under the influence of alcohol, with the onus on the insurer to prove this . In order to discharge this onus, the insurer had to demonstrate that the complainant: Did, in fact, consume alcohol on the day of the incident; and Was influenced by such consumption. The OSTI found that it was a common cause that the insured had consumed roughly four to five beers during the day of the accident. Although the insurer correctly submitted that circumstiaonal evidence must be taken into account, it failed to provide any circumstantial evidence to support its submission that the insured had been influenced by the consumption of alcohol on the evening in question. There were no eyewitnesses to speak on the insured’s demeanour and whether he was influenced by alcohol. The insurer relied on general facts about alcohol consumption, which failed to reflect the insured’s state at the time of the incident. It was unclear whether the statements regarding alcohol were factual, and even if they were, there was no evidence to suggest that the insured was under the influence of alcohol. “All that the insurer could show was that the insured had consumed alcohol, but it failed to provide any evidence that the consumption of alcohol influenced him or that this fact was material to the loss,” said Makamba. “The insurer, therefore, did not prove its case on a balance of probabilities, and the office recommended that the insurer approve and settle this claim. The insurer accepted our recommendation and settled the claim in full.” Read: Three SARS demands you can’t ignore – or risk fines and jail time Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

Fidelity ADT confirmed that within the Fidelity footprint, the number of hijackings recorded during the first half of 2024 increased compared to the corresponding periods during 2023 and the second half of 2023. According to data from the South African Police Services (SAPS), there are 66 reported car hijackings every day, marking a significant 34% increase compared to pre-pandemic levels. The statistics show that approximately half of these incidents take place in Gauteng, while the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal each account for about 14% of the total. It’s important to highlight that these statistics only cover hijackings involving violence or coercion against the driver. The data reveals that there are approximately 10,000 vehicle thefts reported per quarter, which amounts to about 40,000 thefts annually. This information sheds light on the concerning issue of car-related crimes in South Africa. Vehicle hijackings are often described as largely a business driven by demand and supply. As a result, hijackers target specific vehicles for a specific purpose and market. Within the Fidelity footprint, these are the top five vehicles currently being targeted: White Nissan Almera White VW Polo White Toyota Hi-Ace White Nissan NP200 Grey/blue/white Toyota Corolla In the recent past, white and silver vehicles were most often targeted, as per the black market’s demand, which often reflects the mainstream market trends. However, there has been an increased demand for non-traditional coloured vehicles on the road. As a result, vehicles with non-traditional colours , including orange and yellow, have started being targeted more regularly. Traditionally, bright-coloured cars were considered unpopular among hijackers as they stood out easily compared with silver or white cars, making them harder to hide from tracking companies and the authorities. However, Cartrack, a prominent car-tracking company, said the theft of car components has become more widespread than the theft of entire vehicles. It said the high demand for affordable, readily available parts on the black market drives this trend, as these parts are easier to conceal and harder to trace than whole cars. This could explain why colour isn’t much of a deterrent anymore. This is because experienced syndicates with designated chop shops can dismantle any car in minutes. Cartrack noted criminals steal vehicle components effortlessly, with four wheels capable of being removed in five minutes, airbags and tailgates in two minutes, and a battery disconnected in as little as one minute. The tracking company noted that airbags, batteries, tailgates, wheels, and tyres are among the most stolen parts. Cartrack reported incidents of stolen vehicles that were later found completely stripped, indicating the lucrative trade value of illegal chop shops and stolen car parts, which has been estimated at about R442 million. This unlawful practice is seen as a quicker and more profitable alternative to reselling stolen vehicles. Tracker has commented on the latest hijacking hotspots, stating that while shopping malls are still a primary hotspot for thefts in South Africa, their data also shows that sporting and school events are primary hunting grounds for hijackings and car thefts across the country.

The South African Police Service’s (SAPS) latest report shows that approximately 66 cars are being stolen daily, a 6.5% rise from the previous year. Tracker’s latest Vehicle Crime Index highlights similar concerns, noting that hijackings and car thefts had significantly increased by the end of 2023 and into 2024. The index is based on data collected from Tracker’s over 1.1 million subscriptions. Nationally, hijackings accounted for 55% of all vehicle crime incidents, while theft accounted for 45%. Despite these alarming trends, Cartrack, a prominent car-tracking company, said the theft of car components has become more widespread than the theft of entire vehicles. It said the high demand for affordable, readily available parts on the black market drives this trend, as these parts are easier to conceal and harder to trace than whole cars. The tracking company noted that airbags, batteries, tailgates, wheels, and tyres are among the most stolen parts. Cartrack reported incidents of stolen vehicles that were later found completely stripped, indicating the lucrative trade value of illegal chop shops and stolen car parts, which has been estimated at about R442 million. This unlawful practice is seen as a quicker and more profitable alternative to reselling stolen vehicles. Additionally, it has enticed not only seasoned thieves but also car mechanics who engage in dishonest practices, such as replacing car parts with faulty, cheaper ones while repairing vehicles. Criminals can swiftly and relatively effortlessly steal vehicle components, with four wheels capable of being removed in five minutes, airbags and tailgates in two minutes, and a battery disconnected in as little as one minute. This unlawful activity has made second-hand bakkie tailgates highly desirable to criminals, with prices starting from around R2,500 on the illicit market, noted Cartrack. Headlights being stolen from a VW Polo by an identified “highlights gang” in Gauteng . Data from insurance company MiWay seems to align with that of Cartrack, noting that the most frequently stolen accessories include car wheels, wheel caps, car batteries, sound equipment, vehicle mirrors, and headlights. Although all cars have these components, some models are more of a target than others. Several security companies have noted that targets of hijacking and car thefts in South Africa follow the trends of supply and demand in the market. This means the targeted brand and model align with those that are on the country’s road the most, as the demand for the vehicle also raises the demand for its parts. According to Lightstone’s data on monthly car sales, in partnership with Naamsa, Toyota and VW often rank as the first and second best-selling car brands in the country, including their models. This makes their top-selling models, the Hilux bakkie and the VW Polo, prime targets for thefts of wheels, airbags, tailgates and headlights (especially VWs, as seen in the image above). In fact, the demand for their cars has become so rampant on the black market that car manufacturer Toyota noted at the end of 2022 that it would provide free security updates to drivers in South Africa in a bid to counter increased levels of luxury vehicle theft in the country by tech-savvy criminals. Additionally, the theft of headlights from VW vehicles in South Africa, especially Polo and Polo Vivo models, has increased so much in recent years that VW said it is working on finding a solution. VW noted that badges and hubcaps were the main targets for thieves, and they were primarily active in Johannesburg and the surrounding areas, but it has now spread to also stealing headlights, grilles, and bumpers, and crimes of this kind have been reported all over the country. To protect yourself and your vehicle from seasoned thieves, MiWay urged motorists to: Equip your wheels with locknuts. Reinforce your battery bracket. Always park in busy, visible, and well-lit areas. Double-check that your vehicle is locked when you leave it. Keep valuables out of sight. Avoid driving through high-risk areas and known hijacking hotspots. Never connect to unfamiliar Wi-Fi networks from your car. Stay vigilant, and do not be lured out of your car for any reason. Install a GPS tracker so your vehicle can be located if stolen or hijacked. Commenting on the latest hijacking hotspots, Tracker highlighted that while shopping malls remain a primary hotspot for thefts in South Africa , its data also flagged sporting and schooling events as primary hunting grounds for hijackings and car thefts across the country.

Wahl Bartmann, CEO of Fidelity Services Group, confirmed that Fidelity recorded an increase in the number of hijackings during the first half of 2024 compared to the corresponding periods during 2023 and the second half of 2023. As previously mentioned by Bartmann, he explained vehicle hijackings are largely a business driven by demand and supply. As a result, hijackers target specific vehicles for a specific purpose and market. As a consequence, and the increase in the perceived quality of Chinese-branded vehicles, Bartmann noted that Fidelity had noted an increase in the number of these types of vehicles being hijacked. Over the years, the demand for notable Chinese brands such as BAIC, Beijing, Chery, GWM, Haval, Jaecoo, and Omoda has increased significantly. Over the last four years alone, these cars, with many only entering the market within the last couple of years, increased sales from 7,611 in 2020 to 30,850 as of 2023—a 305% increase. Haval and Chery have been the main drivers of this trend. Naamsa’s data shows that Havel has sold approximately 19,904 units, representing an increase of over 2,000% from the 872 recorded in 2019. Chery’s sales are likely to be in the same region. Considering these statistics, it was only a matter of time before Chinese cars filtered into the criminals’ most-wanted list. While Fidelity didn’t mention specific models being targeted, one can make a reasonable assumption based on historical data and trends. As highlighted in several lists of the most hijacked vehicles, the most targeted cars often align with the best-selling cars in the country or the most popular cars on South African roads. Following this notion, Chinese cars, including the Haval Jolion and the H6 SUV, along with Chery’s Tiggo range, which are the respective brands’ best-selling models, could be at a heightened risk for hijackings. Haval H6 Interestingly, the targeting of Chinese cars was flagged as early as 2021. The SAPS issued a warning that they had noted a rise in car hijackings, specifically Haval models. Preliminary investigations and information received from sources showed that the engines of the Chinese-manufactured were removed and fitted into Toyota Quantum minibuses. Additionally, other stakeholders, such as Tracker and insurer Naked, have warned that hijackers target cars built for Africa’s roads, which is why 4x4s are often the target. This could mean GMW’s popular P-Series bakkie could also be rising on the list of cars hijackers are targeting in South Africa. The P-Series would join popular targets such as the Toyota Hilux, Fortuner, and Ford Ranger bakkies. As part of these shifting targets, Bartmann added that the top five vehicles currently being targeted and their colours, as flagged within Fidelity’s footprint, include: White Nissan Almera White VW Polo White Toyota Hi-Ace White Nissan NP200 Grey/blue/white Toyota Corolla GWM P-Series Bartmann urged motorists to be more observant while driving, regardless of the type and colour of their vehicle. “Try to identify any suspicious vehicles that may be following you,” he said. “When a vehicle is following you close to your home and/or when an unknown vehicle is parked close to your residence, drive past your house and to your nearest police station and alert your armed response company. “Vehicle telematics systems are effective tools to help in the recovery of your vehicle. If you haven’t considered one before, I urge you to do so today,” he added. In the unfortunate event that you find you’re being hijacked, Bartmann warns you not to resist. “Remember that perpetrators are always armed and would not hesitate to fire when confronted. “Additional perpetrators may stand out of view and fire should you fight back. A hijacking can happen at any place and at any time,” he said. Should you be hijacked, report the incident to your tracking company and the police as soon as possible.

However, one often overlooked aspect that can significantly impact these transactions is understanding the optimal times to start the process. According to Rikus Blomerus, Chief Marketing Officer at WeBuyCars, the timing of selling your vehicle can greatly influence what you can get for it. He pointed to five broad conditions to look at when timing the sale of your vehicle for optimal gain. These include: Time of year Vehicle depreciation (brand) The type of vehicle Where you live The wider economy Time of year Blomerus noted that buying a used car towards the end of the year is considered a good time because new vehicle manufacturers often support increased sales to avoid carrying inventory into the next year. “They issue various incentives to sell more units, resulting in more trade-ins and available vehicles in the market,” he said. This makes the end of the year a good time to buy and the beginning of the year a good time to sell . Vehicle depreciation Blomerus said that each vehicle follows a unique depreciation curve, with different brands and models losing value at varying rates. “Some vehicles, particularly those known for reliability and strong brand reputation, hold their value better over time. “It is crucial to assess the market valuation of your vehicle and understand your financial standing to sell when the equity—sales price minus outstanding finance—is favourable.” Type of vehicle Blomerus said the demand for vehicle categories also fluctuates throughout the year. For instance, SUVs often experience heightened demand during school holiday periods when families seek spacious vehicles for travel. T he beginning of the calendar year often sees a higher demand for entry-level vehicles , ideal for matric leavers and those starting tertiary education or a first job. “Understanding these trends can help buyers and sellers align their transactions with periods of increased demand, potentially securing better deals,” he said. Where you live Regional market dynamics also play a major role, he said. Urban areas typically experience more dynamic supply and demand forces due to higher population density and market activity. Being aware of regional market trends can give buyers and sellers a strategic advantage. It is also not unheard of for sellers and buyers to actively look at other regional markets and take their buying/selling prospects to those areas for the best deal. Wider economy Blomerus said it is crucial to understand that the aforementioned trends are not solely influenced by seasonal factors but also by broader economic indicators. “Factors such as interest rates, consumer confidence levels, and the dynamic balance of supply and demand in the market play major roles in shaping the pre-owned car market dynamics,” he said. Understanding and monitoring these economic indicators is essential for making informed decisions when buying or selling a used vehicle. “While specific periods of the year may present better deals on pre-owned cars, it is essential for buyers to be financially ready, conduct thorough research, and feel prepared before committing to a purchase. “When armed with this knowledge, consumers can confidently navigate the complexities of the pre-owned car market, ensuring they are well-prepared to capitalise on market opportunities and achieve their desired outcomes,” he said.

Since May 2023, with interest rates held at 15-year highs, it has cost those with vehicle asset finance, on average, an extra R834 per month to cover their loans, which has contributed to the severe financial pressure households are under. This has rippled across the vehicle market as well as first-time car buyers in the country. Data from TransUnion showed that new vehicle prices rose 4.7% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to last year. Combined with interest rates and the marginal increase in the average loan amount, there is evidence that many households are opting for one multi-purpose vehicle rather than maintaining multiple vehicles. Data from WesBank, the largest vehicle and asset finance institution, indicates a 3.5% increase in the average loan amount for new vehicles in June. Additionally, the average deal duration has risen by 3.8% to over 51 months, with the average contract period now exceeding 73 months compared to a year ago. Lebo Gaoaketse Lebo Gaoaketse, head of marketing and communication at WesBank, told BusinessTech that these trends suggest affordability challenges, possibly leading consumers to retain their existing vehicles for longer or extend loan periods to reduce instalments. Wesbank added that high interest rates continue to significantly impact debt, and relief is not expected until the second half of the year or even next year. This is unsurprising when you consider the increased costs associated with the latest interest rate hike cycle. In May 2024, the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB’s) Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The repo rate remains at 8.25%, and the prime lending rate stays at 11.75%. This decision was unanimously agreed upon. The real cost of interest rates Rates have increased by 475 basis points since November 2021, marking the highest levels seen in 15 years. Interest rates have been steady at this level since the last policy rate decision a year ago, adding financial pressure on households as they also grapple with other increased costs, such as electricity, fuel, and property rates. The latest report from TransUnion’s Vehicle Price Index for Q4 2021 indicates that the average value of a financed vehicle is approximately R360,000. This coincides with the start of an interest rate hike cycle. WesBank also noted that the average amount for a new vehicle financed through their institution was about R358,390 at the same time. For those who purchased a car valued at this amount at the beginning of the interest rate hike cycle at 7% (prime rate in September 2021), they have been paying an additional R834 per month on their car loan at the current 11.75% prime rate (since May 2023). Assuming a 60-month (five-year) payment term and a 0% deposit, this results in an extra cost of R10,008 over the past year (May 2023 to May 2024). However, the additional cost increases with the vehicle’s price, as those who bought a R500,000 car pay an extra R1,161 per month, while those who purchased a R1 million car pay a significant R2,320 extra per month. This translates to an additional R13,932 and R27,840, respectively, since May 2023. According to TransUnion, this is partly to blame for the credit bureau’s serious vehicle asset finance delinquency rate of 5.4%—measured as a percentage of accounts three or more months in arrears. Vehicle asset finance delinquencies have worsened by 20 basis points year over year. “Layer in the other inflationary costs of living to that consumer, and you can imagine the pressure on household budgets,” added Gaoaketse. “Those with an option to delay a purchase decision or opt for alternative mobility solutions, including e-haling, sharing, or the pre-owned market, are voting with their feet and exiting the new vehicle market,” he said. Figures released by the Automotive Business Council showed the South African new vehicle market continues its contraction. Passenger cars declined 9% to 26,928 units, while Light Commercial Vehicles were down 24,3% at 10,552 vehicles. Five out of six months of significant market decline have meant that first-half sales look consequently bleak. Year-to-date, new vehicle sales have declined 7.4% to 246,052 units, leaving a possibility of the market failing to reach 500,000 units this year. “Vehicle price inflation, high interest rates, and the general rising costs of living are all impacting the ability of new car buyers to enter or stay in the market,” said Gaoaketse. “Until there is some relief in interest rates, greater incentive deals from manufacturers, or a significant shift in general inflation or earnings, the new vehicle market will continue to remain under pressure,” he added.

Ford has been stable within the South African bakkie market, often ranking among the top four best-selling brands in the country every month. However, this ranking is almost completely a result of the popularity of the Ford Ranger, which consistently ranks as the second best-selling bakkie across South Africa. The Ranger sells roughly over 1,000 units every month, 1,868 in June 2024 alone, second only to the Toyota Hilux (2435 units). As of July 2024, the price of the double-cab Ford Ranger in South Africa is R522,600. Research by TopAuto compared this price to prices in similar markets such as Australia, Brazil, Thailand, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (USA), taking into account the income levels in each region. The comparison found that, on the surface, the price of the Ford Ranger in South Africa is reasonably comparable to prices in other countries. The table below shows the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) for the cheapest five-seater Ranger as listed on Ford’s official websites for each of the five countries: Country Local starting price Price in rands Australia AUD 48,499 R596,959 Brazil BRL 234,990 R771,828 Thailand THB 799,000 R400,664 United Kingdom GBP 29,800 R698,352 United States of America USD 32,720 R601,989 *Currency conversions are accurate as of 3 July 2024. It’s important to note that this is not an apples-to-apples comparison, as the Ranger line-up is tailored to each market. Some markets have access to equipment and trim levels that others do not. However, it’s important to consider each country’s mean income to fully understand the bakkie’s affordability, not just the price tag. In the first quarter of 2024, the average salary paid to formally employed non-agricultural workers in South Africa was R26,791. This works out to approximately R320,500 per annum. The affordability of the Ford Ranger double cab in South Africa is notably higher compared to other markets, as it equates to 1.6 years’ worth of pay for local motorists. In comparison, a Ranger takes a year or less of the average salary to pay off in almost all the comparable markets, with the only exception being Brazil. This raises concerns about the affordability of vehicles for South African consumers compared to those in other nations. In Brazil, the Ford Ranger double cab equates to 2.2 years’ worth of pay for its motorists. It’s important to note that while average salary data provides a general indication, it should be considered in light of various factors, including a country’s population size. Brazil stands out as having the most expensive Ranger relative to income. However, it’s essential to consider that Brazil has a substantial population of 215 million and a higher poverty rate than the other countries on the list, impacting its salary data. The table below shows the average annual salary for the 2023-2024 period in each nation.

The popularity of crossover and standard SUVs has grown significantly among South African drivers. Almost every car brand offers a model in one or both of these segments. \Some popular choices include the Toyota Corolla Cross, Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, and the Nissan Magnite. The practicality and versatility of SUVs make them a popular choice in South Africa due to the country’s diverse terrain and challenging road conditions. The increasing global demand for crossovers and SUVs has prompted most manufacturers to enter this segment in South Africa. While there is a fine line between a crossover and an SUV, over 30 automakers in the country sell one or both body styles. Established brands such as BMW, Toyota, and VW plan to release vehicles with this body style within the next six months to meet the increasing demand for crossovers and SUVs. The highly anticipated next-generation BMW X3 is expected to arrive in the final quarter of the year. It will feature a completely new look and updated powertrains. Additionally, newcomers, including GAC Motor, Jetour, and LDV, are also entering the market. LDV D90 At the same time, the most powerful Land Rover Defender ever, called the Octa, will make its debut. Toyota is also launching a new entry-level crossover in South Africa soon. Although it didn’t explicitly state a specific timeframe before the end of 2024, it would be very surprising if it arrived later than that. This is because the automaker doesn’t currently have a budget-focused SUV in its portfolio, and it continues to lose market share in this segment the longer it waits. The new Toyota model, based on the popular Suzuki Fronx, is known in other countries like India as the Urban Cruiser Taisor. However, it will be sold locally under a different model name, which has not been announced yet. South Africans can expect the arrival of VW’s next-generation Tiguan and facelifted Touareg, which were supposed to be launched in the first half of 2024 but have been delayed for a few months. Additionally, a number of models from Japan are also in the pipeline. China’s GAC Motor plans to start operating in South Africa by the end of the year. It will offer two models, the Emkoo and Emzoom. Emkoo Chery-owned Jetour will also be entering the South African market with the Dashing and X70 Plus models. LDV, a relatively new player in the local automotive industry, will introduce the D90, a seven-seater adventure SUV that will compete with established models such as the Ford Everest and Toyota Fortuner. Furthermore, GWM’s robust Tank 500 is set to hit the roads in South Africa, competing with models like the Toyota Prado and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Chery, Haval, and Jaecoo are also expanding their product lines with new flagship models named the C9, H7, and J8, respectively. Additionally, several new-energy SUVs are set to arrive in South Africa by the end of the year, including the plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Chery Tiggo 7 Pro and Tiggo 8 Pro, the Jaecoo J7 PHEV, the Mini Aceman, and the Omoda E5. The following list outlines the 20 crossovers and SUVs scheduled to launch in South Africa between July and December. Keep in mind that their introduction dates remain tentative and could be delayed at any moment depending on factors such as the exchange rate, port delays, production snags, and more.

The Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) system, which streamlines traffic offences and introduces a demerit points system that could lead to suspended or cancelled licences, was expected to be rolled out across South Africa from 1 July 2024. This deadline was set after Aarto was declared constitutional and lawful by South Africa’s Constitutional Court and Chief Justice Raymond Zondo in July 2023. The Aarto system, which has been in its trial phase for several years in Johannesburg and Tshwane, aims to introduce demerit points in addition to traffic fines for infringements. Demerit points are applied once a fine is paid, an enforcement order is issued, or a person charged with a criminal traffic offence is convicted. Learner drivers can only accumulate up to six points before their licences are suspended for three months. Fully licensed drivers are given fifteen points grace before their driving permit is suspended. However, according to Brandon Cohen, chair of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) and regulatory and compliance expert, the implementation of the Aarto Act and the Aarto Amendment Act has been pushed to mid-2025. Cohen noted that, according to the Department of Transport (DoT) chief director of road regulation, Advocate Johannes Makgatho, the onboarding of municipalities and authorities (phases 2 and 3) would only be completed by December 2024. Additionally, the demerits system is now expected to be implemented between April and mid-2025 (phase 4) , which is a notable delay as this was supposed to come into effect by September 2024 at the latest. Despite the updated timetables, NADA believes the Aarto rollout will be delayed again. It noted a lack of management and the significant administrative burden on a system that is not effective. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) shared a similar view to NADA, noting that despite the ruling declaring Aarto as constitutional and lawful, it doesn’t make the Act practical. Outa said the scheme is impractical because it does not address the root causes of accidents, the risk of corruption, and “administrative cumbersomeness.” “Remember, e-toll was legal, yet failed spectacularly,” it said. The organisation added that it would prove to be difficult to get all 245 municipalities and seven metros to be on board before Aarto can be implemented nationwide. A notable example is Cape Town, which highlighted that the implementation would be a mess and that it is against the idea of having the Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) take 50% of the revenue collected from infringements. Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga confirmed in May of this year that the department (DoT) was in the process of establishing the necessary structures to implement Aarto, including the appointment of the members of the Appeals Tribunal. However, there has not been any public announcement regarding the appointment of the tribunal members. The Automobile Association (AA) also shared its concerns about the rollout of Aarto because of the human and operational resources needed to implement it properly. “We stand by our previous views that the Aarto legislation is geared towards revenue collection and not on promoting safer roads,” the AA said. “Introducing legislation will not solve the country’s road safety crisis. “This merely creates an impression of action while noting will change on the ground, where it is needed [and] as part of our contention, we point to the fact that there is no evidence that the Aarto pilot project saved a single life,” the AA added.

Bakkies are known for their toughness and durability, making them perfect for the country’s diverse landscapes and challenging terrains. Bakkies can easily handle the demanding conditions of both urban and rural areas, making them a versatile choice for many drivers. Additionally, bakkies offer a level of versatility that no other vehicle can match. Whether you need to transport goods, accommodate passengers, or embark on adventurous off-road escapades, bakkies can accommodate your needs. The Toyota Hilux showed that its local customer base remained strong despite economic uncertainty, as it experienced increased sales during the month of the national elections. The popular bakkie sold 2,367 units in May, up 273 units from the 2,094 units sold in April. Following closely was the Ford Ranger, which secured 2,216 new customers in May, maintaining its consistent position as South Africa’s second most popular double-cab option. These two models were the only ones to achieve more than 2,000 purchases, with the rest of the sales significantly lower in comparison. The Isuzu D-Max secured the third spot with 1,282 purchases, showing an improvement from the prior month. Mahindra’s sales declined slightly, but its Pik Up series maintained its position in fourth place, with 716 units sold. The biggest surprise was the performance of the Toyota Land Cruiser 79, which usually ranks around ninth place, and climbed to fifth place with 459 sales. The Nissan Navara followed closely with 423 registrations, and the VW Amarok took the seventh position with 325 sales. Surprisingly, the Nissan NP200 is also still in the top 10, securing the eighth position with 297 units sold. Despite being discontinued in April, the company produced additional stock to meet market demand for a few more months. The model’s continued popularity is evident from its strong sales performance. The last two positions were claimed by GWM’s P-Series and Steed, which sold 205 and 105 units, respectively. The best-selling bakkies in South Africa from May 2024 are detailed below. 1.

The Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (AARTO) Act is expected to start rolling out nationwide soon, bringing with it a host of changes for drivers in South Africa. One of the upcoming changes is the introduction of a new driving demerit system, which will penalize drivers for violating traffic laws. The system will assign demerit points to drivers and vehicle operators guilty of traffic violations, and these points may lead to the suspension or revocation of driving licenses. It’s important to note that this will not exempt drivers from paying speeding fines that they have lawfully received. You can get one of two kinds of fines, regardless of the traffic violation: (1) A Section 56 notice is given to you by a traffic officer, usually for a moving violation. It has a court date on it. (2) A Section 341 notice is sent to a motorist by post for violations caught on traffic cameras or for traffic tickets issued in the absence of the motorists (for example, for an expired licence disc). It does not have a court date on it but is a first notice before summons. The Traffic Department will issue a second notice before actually issuing the summons. It’s essential to recognise the key distinctions between AARTO and fines given by local or provincial authorities. In the latter instances, fines are handled as criminal matters through the courts, while AARTO removes the criminal aspect of speeding and turns it into an administrative procedure. Among the main reasons for implementing AARTO is the need to crack down on lawlessness on South Africa’s roads, which has led to high levels of accidents and deaths. However, some have agreed that it will not change motorists’ behaviour and is just another revenue-making scheme. Despite the doubts towards the reasons for the new system, recent data shows that South Africans are accustomed to breaking the law. The City of Cape Town’s Traffic Service noted that it records an average of 3.6 million offences a year, which translates to around 9,863 fines handed out every day. These cover everything from speeding and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol to false documentation, driving a stolen vehicle, or assaulting an officer. More broadly, throughout the 2024 Easter weekend, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) performed more than 75,000 stops for vehicles travelling along the N1, N3, and N4 and subsequently issued 916,927 fines for various infringements including driving without a licence, drunk driving, driving while overloaded with goods or passengers, and providing false documents. Additionally, more than 1,000 motorists were arrested, and 900 vehicles were impounded across the country’s nine provinces, 274 of which were declared unroadworthy. Considering this, BusinessTech looked at some of South Africa’s most expensive driving offences, which can cost up to R1,500 before arrest. We looked at general road offences that apply to the everyday motorist, not those who operate trucks or public transport vehicles such as taxis. We took the fine amounts from Foresight Publications, which keeps track of roads and transport legislation and numerous fees in the industry, including toll charges and vehicle licence disc renewal fees. According to the publication, the most expensive fine is refusing to give blood or breath samples under the suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. This will cost you R1,500. The second most expensive fine is speeding. Exceeding the speed limit by 26 km/h to 30 km/h will cost you R1,000. However, escalating this from 31 km/h to 35 km/h will cost you R1,250, and 36 km/h to 40 km/h will cost a hefty R1,500. Anything over 40 km/h will result in arrest and a court date. Driving without a license will also cost R1,250. The table below shows all 26 offences that cost R1,000 or more in South Africa. Offence Fine amount Refusing to give blood or breath sample (DUI) R1,500 Exceeding the speed limit by 26 km/h to 40km/h R1,000–R1,500 Smoked before blood/breath specimen was taken R1,250 Driver not licensed R1,250 Motor vehicle not registered R1,000 Motor vehicle not licensed R1,000 Failing to report accident R1,000 Failing to keep to the left R1,000 Driving on the wrong side or across a dividing strip or traffic island R1,000 Overtaking illegally on the left R1,000 Cutting in after overtaking R1,000 Overtaking on the shoulders or verge R1,000 Encroaching the right half of the road, obstructing oncoming traffic R1,000 Accelerating while being overtaken R1,000 Encroaching the right half of the road obstructing oncoming traffic R1,000 Driving across a road when it is unsafe to do so R1,000 Entering a road when it is unsafe to do so R1,000 Overtaking on a blind rise, a curve, or where the view is restricted R1,000 Reversing too far or dangerously R1,000 Following too closely R1,000 Permitting a person to occupy a position in a vehicle restricting the driver’s full control R1,000 Permitting a person to interfere with the steering or operating mechanism R1,000 Driver not positioned to exercise complete control of vehicle R1,000 Racing on public road R1,000 Damaging public road R1,000 Using chocks between the wheel and the road R1,000 Read: R10,000 blow to car owners in South Africa Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

As reported by our sister publication TopAuto , the new E-Class will be available in Avantgarde and AMG Line trims. Both options will have access to one of two separate powertrains, including a 48V mild hybrid (MHEV) technology that provides a boost of 17kW and 205Nm. The base “E200″ has a turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol plant with 150kW and 320Nm, which allows the car to reach 100km/h in 7.5 seconds. Its average fuel consumption is between 6.4l and 7.3l/100km. The other option is a”220d” 2.0-litre turbo-diesel block, which produces 145kW and 440Nm. This option is more powerful than petrol and consumes between 4.8l and 5.5l/100km. However, it is slightly slower, with it taking 7.6 seconds to hit 100km/h. The E-Class, no matter the drivetrain, is rear-wheel drive, and gear changes are handled by a nine-speed automatic gearbox. The new Mercedes also comes with an Agility Control suspension system with selective damping. Buyers will also have the option of installing a rear-axle rear-axle steering package that can turn up to 4.5 degrees, reducing the turning circle by 90cm. The standard E-Class will also come with driving assistance systems, such as Active Distance Assist Distronic, Attention Assist, Active Brake Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Parking Package with reversing camera and Speed Limit Assist. Customers can also buy the Driving Assistance Plus package as an extra, with components including Active Steering Assist, which helps with lane-keeping. “As already on motorways, the E-Class can now also restart automatically in city traffic and on country roads after a longer standstill. Another new feature: if Active Steering Assist is no longer available because the lane markings are not clearly visible, it signals this to the driver by vibrations in the steering wheel,” said Mercedes. Other extras that customers can buy include Thermotronic automatic climate control, as well as an optional front passenger screen, which extends to the central display. Pricing for the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class is as follows: Mercedes-Benz E200 Avantgarde – R1,356,167 Mercedes-Benz E220d Avantgarde – R1,436,259 Mercedes-Benz E200 AMG Line – R1,461,167 Mercedes-Benz E220d AMG Line – R1,541,259 The price includes a 2-year/unlimited-kilometre warranty and a 5-year/100,000km maintenance plan.

Mazda will now have its local head office at the Hertford Office Park, Midrand. “We saw an opportunity to move to a space that better reflects Mazda’s brand repositioning and at the same time accommodate for the changes that have taken place in office and workplace environments,” said Craig Roberts, MD of Mazda Southern Africa. The new workplace is designed to improve the working environment for all team members due to its convenient and central location, office design and available amenities. Moreover, the group will also incorporate a hybrid working model into its operations. “We recognise that the traditional corporate office environment is no longer as effective as is required and no longer appeals to all employees,” said Roberts. “In today’s world of instant and immediate demands on operations, Mazda knows that employee well-being and work-life balance are essential for employees to deliver on their work objectives.” The group is also introducing a WhatsApp and Call-in number, which will be used as a dedicated ‘open line’ for customers to contact the head office. This forms part of the group’s efforts to simplify communications with its customers.

Although the risks of drinking and driving are well documented, the risks that fatigued or drowsy driving are often overlooked despite the dangers. Using research from the Loughborough Sleep Research Centre and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, MasterDrive CEO Eugene Herbert said that fatigued drivers account for over 20% of all road accidents. “Up to 1 in 5 fatal accidents result from tired drivers. Additionally, approximately 1 in 25 drivers report falling asleep while driving, and many more admit to driving while sleep-deprived,” said Herbert. “Lack of sleep has an adverse neuro-behavioural effect on physical and mental behaviours. Fatigue affects a driver’s cognitive abilities, critical driving skills, concentration, reaction times and awareness of hazards.” Drowsy driving can also be made worse during flu season. “A common side-effect of flu medications is drowsiness. Drivers often underestimate the effect this can have. Coupled with the fatigue that accompanies illness, it can be a recipe for disaster. Various studies suggest that driving while fatigued is just as dangerous as drunken driving.” “These medications can come with a multitude of side effects, including extreme drowsiness. If you experience these symptoms while operating a vehicle, you place yourself in a very dangerous position. Rather, hold off on taking any medication until you have arrived safely at the office.” There is no easy solution for those who need to drive for a living. For those on the road a lot, there are close to zero scenarios where it is safe to take flu medication. They should instead take sick leave if recommended by a doctor.

These plates are linked to your vehicle but are also transferable from person to person and from car to car, making them potential investments. In 2016, Wheels24 reported that a collection of single-character Gauteng plates, ranging from “1 – GP” to “8 – GP,” sold for a staggering R1.89 million at auction. While we don’t know the original purchase price, based on today’s rates, the original owner could have paid R52,800 for the set. This shows a remarkable return on investment of 3,480%. You can obtain a “vanity plate” in any province in South Africa, but the costs vary depending on the location and supplier.

Lesufi added that the province’s current registration plates for cars are also running out of combinations, prompting the need for an overhaul of the system. However, The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has expressed concerns, stating that the new vehicle license plate scheme may introduce new controls at a cost. Outa CEO Wayne Duvenage believes that the new “high tech” number plates will have to be more expensive than they currently are. This may drive motorists and businesses to register their plates elsewhere. Outa argues that while improved security features would be helpful if the rule of law were properly enforced, there is no indication that they will truly assist in reducing the spread of fraudulent and cloned plates, as the authorities promised. After announcing that the plates would be available to all motorists in the Gauteng province last month, Premier Lesufi reversed his decision and stated that they would first be introduced to government vehicles during a pilot period beginning in April 2024 and then to private vehicles.

The South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB’s) Monetary Policy Committee voted in May 2024 to hold rates. This means that the repo rate remains at 8.25% and the prime lending rate at 11.75%. The decision was unanimous, and since the beginning of the rate hike cycle in November 2021, rates have been raised by 475 basis points to their highest levels in 15 years. Interest rates have been kept at this level following the last policy rate decision a year ago, which is putting financial pressure on households that are also dealing with other increased expenses such as electricity, fuel, and bond repayments. According to TransUnion’s Vehicle Price Index for Q4 2021, the average value of a financed vehicle is around R360,000, which is around the same time as the start of the interest rate hike cycle. WesBank also noted that the average new vehicle financed through WesBank was roughly R358,390 at the time. This means those who bought a car at this value at the start of the hike cycle at 7% (prime September 2021) have been paying an extra R834 per month on their car loan at 11.75% (prime since May 2023). Assuming a payment term of 60 months (five years) and a 0% deposit, this works out to an extra R10,008 over the past year (May 2023 to May 2024). However, this increases with the price of the vehicle, as those who bought an R500,000 car pay R1,161 extra per month, while the few who purchased a R1 million car pay a notable R2,320 extra per month. These work out to an extra R13,932 and R27,840, respectively, since May 2023. The table below highlights the extra cost of financing a car at the current interest rate compared to September 2021, before the rate hike cycle started, and its accumulation over the past year.

What’s worse, the costs over the period are compounded when you consider that the total cost of vehicle ownership is more than the initial price tag of the vehicle. These additional expenses include the added costs of fuel, comprehensive insurance coverage, and general maintenance and service expenses, all of which have increased over the past year. For example, the cost of unleaded petrol 95 in May 2024 was R25.49 per litre, a difference of R2.64 from the R22.95 in May 2023. This likely added thousands more to the car’s cost. Despite this, petrol recently came down by R1.24 in June 2024, and there is likely more joy to come in July. R1.50 petrol price joy for South Africa The financial strain on consumers in the vehicle market is also evident in the monthly new vehicle sales reports. According to Naamsa, vehicle sales have seen eight consecutive months of declining sales across South Africa. Passenger car volumes were down 6.4% for the first five months of 2024 compared to a year ago. This has been blamed on the high cost of living in the country, which includes high interest rates. “Economic conditions remain tough for consumers within pressurised household budgets,” said Head of Marketing and Communication at WesBank, Lebo Gaoaketse. “However, although the rate remains high, some analyst outlooks indicate that inflation has peaked, which could indicate lower rates during the second half of the year.” Lebo said other positive outlooks for the second half could be spearheaded by the expected significant reduction in fuel prices during June. With a known outlook for the country’s political landscape, more stability can be expected in general market activity, which should be mirrored by new vehicle sales. He added that improved sentiment will also be helped should load shedding continue at low levels, allowing an overall boost in economic activity.

The latest TransUnion Vehicle Pricing Index (VPI) indicated the price of new vehicles rose well above inflation in the last quarter of 2023. The index measures the relationship between the increase in vehicle pricing for new and used vehicles from a basket of passenger vehicles comprising 15 top-volume manufacturers. According to the report, the average price of new vehicles increased by 6.3% in Q4 2023, respectively (1.3% above inflation). The report noted that price increases in almost all segments exceeded the CPI, except for electric vehicles, which only saw a 1.1% increase. On average, the price of all body types rose during the period, with hybrids and hatchbacks experiencing the sharpest increase at 104.% and 7.8%, respectively, in Q4 2023. It’s not surprising that the hatchbacks, which are the cheapest cars from some of the most popular luxury brands, saw the steepest price increases year-on-year. Some of the most popular luxury car brands in South Africa are Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The cheapest models from these manufacturers are priced at well over R500,000, except for the Audi. In 2024, more than 70% of all the cars in South Africa now cost more than R500,000. One of the many contributors to this fact is the poor performance of the local economy and the rand/US dollar exchange rate, which has made it notably more expensive to import and sell vehicles here in recent years. The most affordable German luxury car is the Audi A1, which costs R492,600 in June 2024, up from R487,300 in January. Despite the increase, it’s still over R199,000 cheaper than the BMW 1 Series (R691,716) and over R300,000 cheaper than the most expensive of the three, the Mercedes-Benz A-Class (R796,559 821,491). The A-Class is the most expensive hatchback and has increased by almost R35,000 since January, from R796,559 to R821,491. Interestingly, comparing the cost of a Mecedes-Benz GLA200 from 2014 to 2024 shows that the car’s cost has increased by 131.4% over the past decade. Sales for Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW have more than halved over the same period, with total sales declining from 71,889 in 2014 to 26,202 in 2023—a concerning 63.5% decline. Experts said that this shift is driven by competitive pricing, quality, and high-tech specifications from other manufacturers, such as the Chinese. This is reshaping the competitive landscape and posing challenges for traditional premium dealerships. How much you need to earn in June 2024 Assuming a payment term of 60 months (five years), at a lending rate of 13% (prime (11.75% + 1.25%) and a 0% deposit, the monthly instalment amount of the Audi A1 is roughly R11,305. Experts still recommend that prospective car owners spend no more than 25% of their monthly income on vehicle finance – meaning you’d have to earn no less than R45,000 per month to afford the cheapest car on this list. According to the World Inequality database, this puts you in the top 7% of income earners in South Africa – meaning 93% of the country’s population earns less than you. The cheapest Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are listed below, along with the starting price, estimated monthly instalment, and monthly salary required to afford the vehicle.

According to Ernest North, the co-founder of Naked Insurance, some car makes and models are more susceptible to theft or hijacking, with some being 10 % to 20% more prone to such incidents. This aligns with the sentiments of Fidelity Services Group CEO Wahl Bartmann, who told BusinessTech that vehicle hijackings are primarily a business driven by demand and supply. This is why vehicles manufactured by brands such as Toyota and VW remain high-risk targets. Models such as the Toyota Hilux and the VW Polo are often among the top 10 most-sold cars in South Africa, meaning there is a higher probability of these cars being hijacked. Additionally, North added that the availability of parts significantly influences a vehicle’s attractiveness to thieves. This is a big part of why Toyota is especially targeted, given its popularity across Africa and the availability of its parts. These reasons why certain cars are targets for hijackers also apply to cars at low risk of being stolen or hijacked. Compiling reported incidents of hijackings from January 2021 to April 2023, King Price Insurance put together a list of 10 car brands and models that were the least hijacked cars within their footprint. These cars, as outlined by King Price and in no particular order, are: Audi Q3 Chery Tiggo 4 Pro Ford Fiesta Ford Figo Hyundai Creta Nissan Almera Nissan Magnite Subaru Forester Suzuki Vitara Renault Clio Unlike cars such as Toyotas, many of these cars may not be desirable to hijackers because of their popularity in the rest of Africa and the lack of parts availability. For example, the Ford Fiesta, Figo, and Nissan Almera have been discontinued and are no longer being built, making parts difficult to source and unpopular. Additionally, the Subaru Forester is a very uncommon vehicle among South African motorists, and parts could also be an issue across the rest of Africa. Another interesting factor that could contribute to the reasons for this list is the fact that the Fortuner and Hilux vehicles are stolen mostly for their engines because these vehicles are well-equipped to handle African roads. Evidence of interest in cars that can manage the harsh road conditions in Africa by criminals was also mentioned by insurer Santam. Its report noted a shift from older, low-value vehicles with limited security requirements to more expensive double cabs and SUVs, including Toyota Landcruisers and Prados. Bartmann also noted that approximately 30% of all stolen and hijacked vehicles within Fedelity’s footprint last year were taken across the South African border. It must be noted that while the 10 cars listed have a lower risk of being targeted by criminals, no vehicle can guarantee complete immunity from theft or hijacking attempts. Additionally, the list is relevant to King Price’s experiences and only provides a good indication of the cars that carry low risk. The number of hijacking incidents should be considered relative to the total number of cars on the roads in South Africa. This will provide a more accurate idea of which cars are targeted the least across the country.

In 2024, more than 70% of all the cars in South Africa now cost more than R500,000. One key reason for this spike was the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw car factories around the world shut down and lay off workers when lockdown restrictions were enforced, and the demand for cars dropped. After the easing of restrictions, consumer spending quickly rebounded, while production was slower to return to pre-Covid levels. This created a supply-and-demand problem, leading to inflation. In South Africa, the poor performance of the local economy and the rand/US dollar exchange rate have magnified this effect, making it exponentially more expensive to import and sell vehicles here. According to Tracker, this means the tipping point for South Africans to choose between vehicle ownership and ride-hailing now depends on financial affordability, lifestyle preferences, and evolving urban dynamics. The car-tracking firm said that despite the appeal of ride-hailing services, many young adults and first-time buyers still see car ownership as a symbol of independence and mobility. However, car prices and economic constraints, combined with factors such as student debt and job market uncertainty, may delay or prevent them from realising this aspiration. The table below compares the monthly travelling costs of a Suzuki S-Presso versus taking an Uber, as outlined by the tracker. Distance Travelled Car Owner Uber Go Uber X Uber Comfort 600km/month (20km/workday + 20km/weekend day R6 688 R4 740 R5 640 R6 300 1020km/month 40km/workday + 20km/weekend day R8 721 R7 092 R8 706 R9 660 1440km/month 60km/workday + 20km/weekend day R10 753 R9 738 R12 108 R14 406 The total cost of owning a car was calculated based on a vehicle price of R175,000. The car was financed over 72 months at 13% interest with a 10% residual value. The total cost includes petrol, maintenance, insurance at a rate of R4.84/km, and other miscellaneous expenses such as R200 for parking and R139 for tracking fees. Additionally, Uber rates for different service levels (including “Go” and “Comfort”) were recorded to show the potential charges for Joburg commuters during work hours. Based on these calculations, using ride-hailing services can be cost-effective if you travel around 1,400km per month. However, beyond this distance, it may be more economical to own your own car. If you’re considering purchasing a vehicle that is more expensive than the cheapest option available, Uber could still be the more affordable choice, even if you travel well over 1,000km every month. Tracker points out that when the finance contract expires, as long as you have been making your payments diligently, you will have a fully paid-off car. At that point, you will only need to cover the running costs, and you won’t have this type of reward if you choose to drive for Uber instead. On the other hand, due to the depreciation of vehicles, the company suggests that if you were to save the difference between owning a car and using e-hailing each month and invest it in an interest-bearing account, you could end up with a more substantial financial asset after several years than if you had an old vehicle.

Although parking lots are often not named as hotspots for accidents, the National Safety Council in the USA reported over 50,000 parking lot accidents each year, accounting for roughly 20% of all car crashes. Moreover, there are as many as 500 deaths due to parking lot collisions. “While South Africa’s stats are limited, it is safe to assume that parking lots here are just as an ideal location for collisions with other vehicles, people and stationary objects,” said MasterDrive CEO Eugene Herbert. “Unfortunately, drivers in parking lots do not give the same respect to road signs and markings that they do on other roads.: “Additionally, distraction amongst both drivers and pedestrians is more prevalent. Lastly, as drivers have just reached their destination, their awareness levels also automatically drop. This all combines to create an accident waiting to happen.” MasterDrive thus gave tips to avoid collisions in parking lots: Follow the rules! Drivers should not ignore any road markings or signs in a parking lot. All road laws apply, such as driving in the left-hand lane and obeying one-way lanes. Don’t speed The generally accepted speed limit in parking lots is not to exceed 10km/h. “Even if the lot seems empty, it is the perfect place for people to suddenly step into your lane or a car to unexpectedly reverse out. Additionally, stopping in time is difficult with less time and space to react.” Hyperawareness In parking lots, drivers should also be aware of people walking to their vehicles (who are also ignoring road rules), such as children who may run out. When leaving a parking spot, you must be aware of all objects or persons that could be collided with. Be selective “The perfect parking spot is not the one closest to the entrance, it is the one safest to exit later. A parking spot where drivers can pull through are the best.” “Be sure there is nothing dividing the spots. If you cannot find a pull-through, reverse into your parking spot. This provides the best visibility when leaving. Ideally, select a spot against a wall in a well-lit area.” Extra check When climbing into your car, look around and make sure that there are no smaller obstacles that are not visible once you are inside. Rearview = limited view Do not depend on rearview cameras to reverse into or out of a parking spot. It is an aid for reversing, not a replacement for mirrors or checking over your shoulder.

According to car-tracking company Cartrack, criminals may target you by driving behind you and intentionally bumping into your vehicle at a low to moderate speed. This is done to get your attention without causing significant damage to the vehicle they plan to steal. Once you stop and exit the vehicle to assess the damage and exchange insurance information, the hijackers may overpower you and steal your car, leaving you stranded on the roadside. Cartrack also reports that hijackers may use a woman as a decoy driver to give their target a false sense of security. The “tap-tap” tactic exploits the South African National Road Traffic Act, which requires drivers to pull over after an accident, regardless of its severity. According to Arrive Alive, motorists who do not stop after an accident can be prosecuted. If found guilty, they may be fined up to R36,000 or face a prison sentence of up to nine years. In this situation, Fidelity Security recommends signalling to the other driver and driving to a busy location before exiting your vehicle. By doing so, you can ensure your safety and assess the situation. If the accident was not legitimate, the motorists in the other vehicle are unlikely to follow you to a busy location. The most recent crime statistics released by the South African Police (SAPS) indicate that carjacking incidents increased by 365 across all nine provinces, reaching a total of 5,973 reported cases. This means that an average of 65 vehicles were reported as hijacked in South Africa every day. Similarly, other vehicle-related crimes also saw an increase, with theft of motor vehicles and motorcycles rising by 0.9% to 9,539 incidents, and theft from motor vehicles increasing by 0.5% to 22,288 reports. According to the South African Police Service (SAPS), there has been a significant increase in carjackings in three provinces. These provinces are Gauteng, which experienced a 14.4% increase; the Western Cape, with a 14% increase; and the North West, with an 11% increase. Interestingly, Kwa-Zulu Natal saw a notable decrease of 17.6% in carjackings, while the Eastern Cape experienced a decrease of 5.2%. Carjackings are most prevalent in South Africa’s most densely populated regions, including Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal, and the Western Cape. Gauteng recorded 3,010 carjackings, constituting 50.4% of all reported incidents, while the Western Cape experienced 856 carjackings, and Kwa-Zulu Natal saw 834.

The skyrocketing prices of new cars have made it difficult for the average South African to afford a vehicle, with less than 25% of all car models priced under R500,000. Car prices have risen significantly in recent years due to various factors, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, safety and legal requirements, and changing consumer preferences. The Covid-19 pandemic led to a drop in car demand, prompting most car brands to raise prices to survive. Additionally, consumer expectations have influenced the standard features in modern cars, with common inclusions such as infotainment touchscreens, air conditioning, cruise control, LED headlights, and more. However, integrating these features comes at a cost, making cars more expensive. While there are hatchbacks that offer all the luxuries a modern-day car can provide at a premium price, such as those from BMW and Audi, the segment also includes some of the most affordable cars on the market. This makes hatchbacks an appealing option for budget-conscious buyers seeking a reliable and efficient vehicle. Considering this, BusinessTech looked at the best vehicles one could afford with a monthly instalment budget of R5,000. A budget of R5,000 a month affords only a handful of cars currently available on the South African market, Two of which are among the most popular hatchbacks, according to Naamsa’s latest new vehicle sales reports. To calculate the monthly instalments of the vehicles on this list, we used Wesbank’s repayments calculator with the following parameters: Payment term – 60 terms (5 years) Interest – 11.75% Deposit – 0% Balloon – No balloon payment Extras – No optional extras Using these assumptions, seven new vehicle models are affordable with a monthly instalment budget of R5,000, including three automatics. The cheapest of these automatic cars is the Suzuki S-Presso 1.0 GL+ Auto, which costs R203,900 or R4,606 per month. The other cars with automatic transmissions are the Renault Kwid (R216,999 or R4,895 per month), and the Proton Saga (R224,900 or R4,904 per month). It must be noted that while some of these cars offer cheaper models in their range – equating to an even cheaper monthly instalment – we chose the top-spec models one can afford with a budget of R5,000 per month. For example, while the Suzuki S-Presso S-Edition auto costs R203,900, the model’s entry-level variant costs only R178,900—that’s an instalment of only R4,052 per month. With this in mind, the seven best cars you can afford on a R5,000 monthly instalment budget are listed below. Suzuki S-Presso 1.0 GL+ Auto Car price: R203,900 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,606 Model starting price: R178,900 Suzuki Celerio 1.2 GL Car price: R210,900 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,760 Model starting price: R188,900 Suzuki DZire 1.2 GL Car price: R211,900 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,783 Model starting price: R211,900 Suzuki Swift 1.2 GA Car price: R213,900 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,827 Model starting price: R213,900 Renault Kwid 1.0 Zen Auto Car price: R216,999 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,895 Model starting price: R196,999 Toyota Vitz 1.0 XR Car price: R219,900 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,904 Model starting price: R189,900 Proton Saga 1.3 Standard Auto Car price: R224,900 Estimated monthly instalment: R4,904 Model starting price: R209,900 Read: 18 new cars launching in South Africa in the coming months Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Lifestyle · 13h Unique South African school achieves 100% university exemption and 4.4 distinctions per student Energy · 14h South Africans to pay for R76 billion mistake Government · 15h Dark times ahead for an important South African industry Finance · 16h Tax return warning for over 500,000 taxpayers in South Africa Business · 18h R17 billion boost for South African-born billionaire since the start of 2026 Government · 19h Europe gives South Africa the green light Industry News Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech More News Business · 21h Tax disaster for one of South Africa’s major employers 5 Things · 22h South Africans must still use Post Office for parcels under 1kg, and SAPS in deep trouble Business · 23h Store cheaper than Checkers and Pick n Pay launches nationwide delivery Lifestyle · 13 Jan 2026 South Africa’s top-performing private school with 4.3 distinctions per matriculant Government · 13 Jan 2026 AGOA hope for South Africa Lifestyle · 13 Jan 2026 25-year-old foreigners are retiring in South Africa Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

Unlike many other nations, South Africa is still very far behind in adopting hybrid and electric vehicles, with cost a significant factor. South Africa currently has a 25% import tax on EVs, far lower than the 18% it levies on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Other countries offer tax incentives to increase EV uptake. Although outgoing Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel said that there will be tax reductions on investments in the local production of electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, this is primarily for exports and not South Africa’s own market Another uniquely South African issue is load shedding, with Eskom barely being able to keep the lights on currently without further strain on the grid caused by the charging requirements of these cars. Although not completely “green”, hybrid cars can offer the best of both worlds through an ICE engine that powers a battery. With the costs of hybrids and electrics still far above their ICE, the fuel-saving benefit becomes the most important factor when comparing costs. Our own comparison shows that it can take a few years to “break even,” with hybrids taking a few years longer as they still use fuel. Hybrid vs ICE – Toyota Corolla Cross The Toyota Corolla Cross is one of the best-selling cars in South Africa and is the cheapest hybrid available. While the retail price for a petrol version starts from R408,400, the hybrid starts at R486,100. A person who drives 20,000 km per year inland and uses 95 petrol would save roughly R13,303 per year in fuel by driving a hybrid. This means it will take just under six years to hit the break-even point, where the fuel saving results in an overall saving. Corolla Cross Petrol Hybrid Difference Retail Price R408 400 R486 100 R77 700 Fuel Consumption 6.8l 4.3l 2.5l Drive 20 000 km R35 224 R21 921 R13 303 Break Even Point – – 5.84 years Electric vs Petrol Vehicles We compared the price and fuel efficiency of a Mini Copper 3-Door Hatch and a Mini Cooper SE for the electric comparison. In terms of price, the electric models come at over R100,000 more. However, as the electric car does not use fuel, the savings would total R30,000 per year, meaning that it would take just over three years to hit the break-even point. Mini Cooper 3 Door Petrol Electric Difference Retail Price R610 884 R 713 702 R102 818 Fuel Consumption 6.0l – – Drive 20 000 km R30 588 – – Break Even Point – – 3.36 years It should be noted that these are just examples, and potential savings could revolve around several other aspects, such as driving distance per year, the fuel price at the time, and the car chosen. With the world slowly transiting to greener cars, these differences could lower even further in the coming years when South Africa eventually joins the party.

In 2024, more than 70% of all the cars in South Africa now cost more than R500,000. One key reason for this spike concerns the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw car factories around the world shut down and lay off workers when lockdown restrictions were enforced, and the demand for cars dropped. After the easing of restrictions, consumer spending quickly rebounded, while production was slower to return to pre-Covid levels. This created a supply-and-demand problem, leading to inflation. In South Africa, the poor performance of the local economy and the rand/US dollar exchange rate have magnified this effect, making it exponentially more expensive to import and sell vehicles here. To reflect the magnitude of vehicle price increases, BusinessTech looked at the prices of a Mercedes-Benz GLA200 in 2014 compared to today in 2024 and how much you need to afford it in their respective time periods. In 2014, a GLA200 cost R398,800. According to financing experts, individuals should spend no more than 25% of their monthly income on vehicle-related costs, which means they would have required an estimated salary of around R35,000 per month. This assumes the cars are financed over five years (60 months) at an annual interest rate of 10.5% (prime in 2014 (9.25%) +1.25%, with a 0% deposit or balloon payment. Fast-forward to 2024, and the vehicle now costs R922,841—a R524,000 increase or 131%—which requires a salary increase of R50,000 or 141% to R84,300 per month to afford the same car. This assumes the same parameters as in 2014 but at an annual interest rate of 13% (2024 prime (11.75%) +1.25%). Model Price 2014 Price 2024 Change Mercedes-Benz GLA200 R398 800 R922 841 +R524 041 (131.4%) Model Income 2014 (pm) Income 2024 (pm) Change Mercedes-Benz GLA200 R34 668 R84 376 +R49 708pm (143%) To put this into perspective, the range-topping Kia Picanto is now R325,995 , which is only R72,800 or 18% less than the Mercedes-Benz GLA200 back in 2014. The increase in the cost of this Mercedes-Benz vehicle is more than double the inflation rate over the same period (66.1%), showing the rapid and unsustainable increases in car prices over the past decade. What’s worse is that salaries have just kept behind inflation since 2014 . According to Stats SA, the average formally employed non-agricultural worker in 2014 earned an average of R16,400 per month, which has increased to R26,894 in 2024—representing an increase of 64% (2.1% below inflation). When comparing the cost of a Merc to an average salary, those who could afford a GLA200 in 2014 needed just over double the average salary. In 2024, they now need to earn triple the average salary to afford the same car. Looking at another model revealed a similar outcome to the GLA200. In 2014, a Mercedes-Benz C200 cost R436,600, and it now costs R1,042,139—a 138% increase in price over the decade. This massive increase in prices is one of the several reasons why premium European car brands have seen a notable drop in sales over the same period, as outlined by the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). Sales for Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW have more than halved in the last decade, with total sales declining from 71,889 in 2014 to 26,202 in 2023—a concerning 63.5% decline. According to Lightstone’s latest statistics, sales for Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo dropped from 28,757 units in 2022 to 26,836 in 2023, a 6.6% decline, which is around the annual average since 2014 (6.35%). What’s worse is this trend seems to be accelerating, with year-to-date sales of these car brands as of April 2024 reflecting a drop of over 10% compared to the same period in 2023.

With many South Africans facing a challenging economic situation, it is useful to see how they can save on certain purchases, such as buying a car. It may not be fair to compare a 10-year-old car with one that is a year old, as cars with higher mileage will not be in the same condition as ones off the showroom floor. “But, a one-year-old car that’s still new could be more reliable than one straight out of the dealership,” said Old Mutual. “Any problems with a new car are usually experienced in the first few months, and if you are buying a used car with 30,000km on the clock, these will probably already have been sorted out.” “Consider, then, what you’re getting for the premium paid for a brand new vehicle if reliability isn’t a factor: new car smell, a more shiny finish?” A new car also massively depreciates as soon as it leaves the showroom floor, and there can be a big difference between a brand-new car and one with some mileage. For instance, when BusinessTech browsed for cars in Gauteng on AutoTrader, a few kilometres can massively reduce the car’s selling price. For instance, in our search, a 2024 Volkswagen Polo Vivo Hatch 1.4 Trendline that had only driven 10km already lost roughly 5% of its show floor value . A 2024 Suzuki Swift 1.2 GL could lose just under 8% of its value if it has driven 50km, which is shorter than a drive from Johannesburg and Pretoria’s CBDs. Below are the top five selling cars in South Africa and what they cost, new and used. Car New Used ( Mileage ) Difference 2023 Toyota Hilux 2.0 S (Aircon) R372 200 R319 950 (21 175 km) 14.03% Ford Ranger 2.0 Sit Single Cab XL Manual R514 800 R399 900 (30 738 km) 22.32% 2024 Volkswagen Polo Vivo Hatch 1.4 Trendline R262 700 R249 995 (10km) 4.83% 2024 Suzuki Swift 1.2 GL R233 900 R215 900 (50km) 7.69% Toyota Corolla Cross 1.8 Xi R408 400 R399 900 (1 500 km) 2.08% For those who like a bigger engine, a carbon tax will also apply to new cars, but not older versions. Source: Old Mutual Old Mutual said that the only real reason to buy a new car is that it allows one to spec the car out the way one wants it. “Some would say that the warranty is also a good reason, but this is usually not true. If you bought a year-old car with a five-year warranty, the vehicle would still be covered for four years when you bought it, and by this point the vehicle will have already seen its greatest drop in value,” said the insurer. “It’s for these reasons that we believe that cars between one and two years old are the best buys. They’re typically still under warranty, they represent good value for money, and, because they are later models, they’re more fuel efficient than older models.” “This doesn’t mean that you can’t get a good deal with an older vehicle. You can, but you have to be a little more careful in choosing your purchase.” Read : What to expect from interest rates this week – and three key things to look out for Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 6h Best Afrikaans school in South Africa with 3.62 distinctions per matric Property · 8h Most enviable South African suburbs to live in – with homes selling for up to R47 million Property · 11h Warning for South Africans living in estates and sectional titles Lifestyle · 14h One of South Africa’s semigration hotspots in serious trouble Lifestyle · 17h The government school outperforming most private schools in South Africa Property · 16 Jan 2026 New R2 billion luxury beach resort and safari lodge in South Africa to launch soon Industry News Partner content How BusinessTech sponsored articles help South African companies thrive Partner content Domains.co.za launches South Africa’s own Link in Bio tool Partner content Resetting the standard: leadership lessons for 2026 Partner content Altron FinTech expands Kasi Sales Squad to Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD, bringing enterprise payment solutions to township entrepreneurs Partner content New year, new training budget: The skills decisions that will matter most this year Partner content Somerset College IEB matric results 2025 – 100% pass rate and over 4 A symbols per student More News Finance · 16 Jan 2026 Big changes on the table for South Africa’s Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant Lifestyle · 16 Jan 2026 New long-haul international flight coming to South Africa Government · 16 Jan 2026 World-class South African facility collapsed despite R500 million funding Energy · 16 Jan 2026 Here is the expected petrol price for February Business · 16 Jan 2026 End of an era for 135-year-old South African company Property · 16 Jan 2026 Sale of R1.6 billion luxury shopping mall in South Africa’s richest area collapses Poll What was your matric average? 90%+ 80% to 89% 70% to 79% 60% to 69% 50% to 59% 40% to 49% 30% to 39% Less than 30% View results Loading ...

Gone are the days of having only two options when renewing your vehicle licence disc. This often involved standing in long queues at a licencing centre or Post Office, taking more than a couple of hours out of your day to complete. In 2024 there are now several avenues that South Africans can take to renew their discs – including dedicated online licencing services, banks, retailers, and the long-standing post office. Last year, the Road Traffic Management Corporation said that there was a mounting number (over 1 million) of licence disks about to expire. As a result, it said that it is taking proactive steps to get motorists to renew on time and is sending out email and SMS reminders to owners whose motor vehicle licences are expiring. In South Africa, motorists are given a 21-day grace period to renew an expired motor vehicle licence. The grace period is calculated from the expiry date of the current licence disc, and a late renewal penalty applies after this time. The penalty fee is calculated at 10% of the annual licencing fee every month the licence remains lapsed. So, for example, if your annual licencing fee is R384 (as it is in Gauteng for a vehicle exceeding 750kg but not exceeding 1,000kg), the penalty for not renewing your licence would be R38.40 per month. Cheapest options FNB’s services emerge as the cheapest options, with nationwide promotional prices sitting at R69 and regular prices at R99. This is a substantial drop from the R171 that they charged in October 2023. Government’s National Traffic Information System (Natis) Online similarly sits at R99. The South African Post Office (SapoMVL) is next at R147, which involves a R72 service fee and R75 delivery fee. Last year’s cheapest option, PayCity, now sits at fourth at R166.75 – a R52.90 increase. The most expensive option belonged to Pick n Pay, at R329.99. However, Pick n Pay told MyBroadband that this service was suspended in mid-2023 until it is satisfied with its “new” offering. This suggests that the company is planning to relaunch licence disc renewals in the future. The prices to renew a vehicle licence with the service providers discussed are summarised in the table below, as outlined by MyBroadband .

Consumer intelligence company J.D. Power’s latest vehicle dependability study crowned Lexus the most dependable vehicle brand for the second year in a row. Toyota’s parent company won the mass market, while Porsche and BMW topped the rankings for premium brands. The Porsche 718 was also named the most dependable car model. Buick, Chevrolet, and Mini also make the overall top five. However, Buick and Chevrolet are no longer available in South Africa following General Motors’s exit from South Africa in 2017 as part of a global restructuring. Big businesses calling it quits in South Africa Tesla was at the bottom of the list, with J.D. Power saying that owners of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles face more problems than owners of gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. Technology-related problems are the biggest issues facing cars, with the most problematic vehicle category being infotainment, which sees nearly twice as many problems as the next-highest category, exterior. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are the top problems, followed by built-in voice recognition. For cars available in South Africa, Audi was at the bottom of the reliability ratings. According to a recent Consumer Reports (CR) study , another German manufacturer, Mercedes Benz, was the least reliable brand available in South Africa. Volkswagen was also named in the bottom five in both studies. VW investing R4 billion into South African plant – with a new car in the works On the other end of the scale in the Consumer Reports study, Lexus and Toyota were again named as number one and two for reliability, respectively. Mini again made the top five, getting a bronze medal. When it comes to Premium Brands, Porsche and BMW again top the list, even though Hondas, Subarus, and Mazdas are seen as more reliable.

As a result, many South Africans are avoiding premium cars and opting for the new wave of Chinese vehicles entering the market. Aggregate new vehicle sales during the first quarter of 2024 recorded a decline of 5.6% compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023 and a marginal increase of 0.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), economic pressure and political uncertainty are hindering growth in the sector. The budget speech and the upcoming general election have strained consumer pockets, compounded by the Reserve Bank Governor’s statements on maintaining high interest rates, adding to the prevailing negative sentiment. NADA observed a trend of consumers downsizing and conducting extensive research into pricing and financing options. “Affordability remains a crucial factor in purchasing decisions,” it said. According to the association, South Africans are increasingly turning to more budget-friendly vehicles due to economic challenges, high interest rates, and escalating fuel costs. The group also noted that the local market is becoming increasingly competitive, with a growing number of Asian participants – particularly Chinese brands making a significant impact in both the passenger car and overall truck markets. According to statistics from Naamsa, there is a noticeable trend towards Chinese-manufactured vehicles. In 2019, Haval had only sold 872 cars, while Chery wasn’t even on the radar. Fast-forward to 2024, Chinese cars are now outselling many traditional and trusted brands such as Kia, Renault, Isuzu, and even BMW and Mercedes-Benz. According to Naamsa’s data, Havel has sold approximately 19,904 units, representing an increase of over 2,000% from that recorded in 2019. Additionally, these numbers show a stark increase in Haval’s sales since 2019, representing a 198% increase, while Chery’s sales are likely to be in the same region. This shift has hit premium manufacturers such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo. Sales for Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW have more than halved in the last decade, with total sales declining from 71,889 in 2014 to 26,202 in 2023— a concerning 63.5% decline . According to Lightstone’s latest statistics, sales for Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo dropped from 28,757 units in 2022 to 26,836 in 2023, a 6.6% decline, which is around the annual average since 2014 (6.35%). What’s worse is this trend seems to be accelerating , with year-to-date sales of these car brands as of April 2024 reflecting a drop of over 10% compared to the same period in 2023. As stated by NADA, this shift is driven by competitive pricing, quality, and high-tech specifications, which are reshaping the competitive landscape and posing challenges for traditional premium dealerships. NADA also observed that the premium segment is under compounded pressure, with customers moving from new vehicles to demos and pre-owned cars. The group noted that some loyal premium brand customers are extending maintenance plans, but the majority are either buying down, waiting, or transitioning to pre-owned vehicles. This has led to significant growth in the pre-owned car market compared to new cars. Economic pressures and shifting market dynamics are re-evaluating traditional brand loyalty. Consumers are adapting to budget-friendly options, including Chinese-manufactured vehicles, marking a significant shift in the industry landscape.

Despite being essential in protecting your assets, getting insurance quotes is often a tedious process, with many South Africans dealing with call centre agents who try to sell you on convoluted packages. Thus, we decided to sacrifice our own time and contact details and compare car insurance prices. It should be noted that insurance quotes are highly dependent on one’s own circumstances, such as age, criminal history and prior insurance coverage. The car’s make, model, colour, and how it is driven are also important factors in pricing. What is covered is also highly important. As every insurer offers different levels of coverage per price, we only looked at the cheapest option for each insurer. We decided to keep the comparison as true to life as possible and acted as a consumer who is strapped for time and primarily looks at the headline figures. We compared quotes for a new white 2024 Toyota Starlet 1.5 Xr automatic (R339,000) for an under-25-year-old male driver. Although we take our jobs seriously, receiving calls from every single short-term insurer and having to explain that we don’t actually have the car would drive us insane. Thus, we only looked at online quotes via Hippo or, if the information wasn’t available on Hippo, through the insurer’s websites directly. Notably, while sticking to strictly digital means, we still received several calls from insurers—some of whom were very friendly but likely annoyed by us not buying a product or even having a car to insure in the first place. Overall, the lowest quote offered to us was from Naked Insurance, which was R1,119 per month. This was R200 lower than the second-place MiWay Blink, which came out at R1,382. The third place was Old Mutual Iwyze, which offered insurance of R1,657. Old Mutal Insure was the fourth cheapest at R1,718, while Pineapple, which is underwritten by Old Mutal, came fifth at R1,740. On the other end of the scale, Auto & General’s Virsker was the most expensive in this case study, at R2,522.

In January 2024, the price of petrol 95 and 0.005% diesel was set at R22.49 and R20.73 per litre, respectively. Fast-forward five months, and in May 2024, these prices increased by over 13% and 7%, respectively. While diesel saw some relief in the last two months, petrol saw four consecutive increases totalling R3.00. Bloomberg analysis shows that although oil prices have been relatively stable, they have gradually increased since the start of the year. This can be attributed to the production cuts by oil-producing countries (OPEC+), the ongoing tensions in the Middle East, and disruptions in shipping in the Red Sea. Currently, the volatile oil markets are significantly impacting petrol prices in South Africa. In May, due to the instability in the oil market, the under-recovery rate is being affected by 37 cents per litre. As a result, South Africans are now firing out R25.49 and R22.24 per litre at the pumps. However, early signs point to some relief next month. The rand has enjoyed some relative strength in May, as tensions around the coming 2024 elections have eased and markets anticipate a more business-friendly result. According to Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop, the rand is likely to remain volatile but would strengthen on an earlier US rate cut and around 45% ANC voter support, with no ANC/EFF coalitions. Additionally, with OPEC+ nations curtailing output to prevent a glut and shore up global prices, oil prices are still relatively stable and a far stretch from the $90+ a barrel seen earlier in the year. As a result, mid-month data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF) pointed to price cuts across the board. Here is the expected petrol price for June Despite this, South Africans are still paying notably more for fuel compared to the beginning of the year in January. The table below shows the pump prices in January compared to May 2024. Inland January official May official Change 95 Petrol R22.49 R25.49 +R3.00 Diesel 0.005% (wholesale) R20.73 R22.24 +R1.51 The tables below show the cost of filling up your car’s tank with petrol and diesel inland in May compared to January 2024.

The South African automotive industry’s eight-month streak of reduced sales has finally ended. The sector recorded a marginal improvement of 2.2% to reach 38,172 units in April 2024. Of these 38,172 cars sold, 89.9% were sold through dealerships, 5.0% were sold to the rental industry, 2.7% went to the government, and 2.4% were sold to corporate fleets. Passenger cars made up 25,972 units and showed a year-on-year improvement of 6.1%. On the other hand, light commercial vehicles such as bakkies, minibuses, and panel vans decreased by 9.0% to reach 9,646 units. Although local sales slightly increased, exports dropped significantly by 23.9% compared to the same month last year, with only 23,394 units being sent overseas. Naamsa credits the improvement in local sales to a month without any power outages, which helped improve operating conditions and consumer confidence. The top 10 brands that sold the most cars locally in April 2024 were: Toyota – 8,541 units Suzuki – 4,891 units Volkswagen Group – 4,758 units Ford – 2,614 units Hyundai – 2,134 units Chery – 2,009 units Isuzu – 1,540 units GWM – 1,493 units Nissan – 1,443 units Renault – 1,307 units Best-selling models The Toyota Hilux is still South Africa’s best-selling vehicle, although its sales numbers have decreased significantly compared to the previous month. In April 2024, the bakkie managed to secure 2,094 new customers, which is a 32.5% decrease from the 3,104 units it achieved in March. The Ford Ranger saw a small improvement, reaching 2,073 units and climbing three spots to reach second place. Despite lower sales compared to the previous month, the VW Polo Vivo was another big winner in April, placing third with 1,766 sales. The Suzuki Swift moved up from seventh to fourth place with 1,725 units, and the Toyota Corolla Cross rounded out the top five with 1,573 units, although this is lower than its March sales. Other cars in the top 10 include the Isuzu D-Max, Toyota Starlet, Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, Nissan Magnite, and Hyundai Grand i10, each selling between 1,202 and 825 units.

In recent months, several new brands, such as GAC Motors, Foton, and LDV, have announced their plans to enter the market. LDV has already launched its first vehicle, the T60 bakkie, and is set to introduce an SUV, MPV, and panel van in the near future. Foton is planning to re-enter the South African market in June with its own double cab, the Tunland G7. The company will also launch several light and medium commercial vehicles that are aimed at the business sector. Another newcomer, GAC Motors, is introducing three new SUVs – two of which run on petrol and the third on battery electricity (BEV). Additionally, BYD is planning to launch its second car in South Africa in the near future, which will be called the Dolphin. This electric hatchback is poised to become the country’s cheapest BEV with a projected starting price of R550,000. Chery is all set to launch new plug-in hybrid models of its popular Tiggo 7 Pro and 8 Pro SUVs, making them more fuel-efficient and eco-friendly. In addition to this, Chery’s sub-brands Jaecoo and Omoda are also introducing new models to the market. Jaecoo will introduce two new models, the J7 PHEV and the luxurious J8, which are expected to be packed with premium features and advanced technologies. Moreover, the J6, an electric SUV, has been rebranded from Chery’s “iCar” division and will also be part of the launch. On the other hand, Omoda fans can look forward to the flagship C9, which has been pulled from Chery’s Exeed brand, and the E5, an electric version of the C5 that is already on sale. These new models are expected to set new benchmarks in terms of performance, efficiency, and sustainability, and will provide customers with a wide range of options to choose from. GWM is expanding its line-up by introducing the P500 bakkie and the Tank 500 SUV model. Meanwhile, Haval is launching two new vehicles – the Jolion Pro and H7. Additionally, JAC’s T9 double cab, which was previously only available with a turbocharged diesel engine, is expected to receive two new powertrains – a PHEV and BEV option. All these Chinese cars are expected to arrive in South Africa before the end of this year, although some models may experience delays at short notice.

The AARTO system, which has been in its trial phase for several years in Johannesburg and Tshwane, is said to aim to improve road safety by addressing traffic violations more effectively and strictly. However, some critics say that it is instead aimed at revenue collection rather than road safety. What the AARTO entails Some of the key features of the AARTO system include: Points demerit system : Each traffic violation carries a certain number of demerit points. Accumulating too many points can result in penalties such as license suspension (12 points) or cancellation (15). Fine payment and appeals process : Offenders receive notices of traffic violations and have the option to pay fines or contest the charges through a formal appeals process (through a tribunal). Infringement notices and penalties : Offenders receive infringement notices detailing the alleged violation and the associated penalty. Penalties may include fines, demerit points, or both. Driver rehabilitation : The AARTO system includes provisions for driver rehabilitation programs aimed at reforming habitual traffic offenders. Traffic fines “are a very confusing space with multiple websites and traffic fine systems,” Barry Berman, CEO of Fines SA, said in an interview with Kaya Biz . “[AARTO] puts all [traffic offence] systems into one place so that motorists know exactly where they stand – what outstanding fines they have, where there are discounts applicable, and they can pay all of their fines on a national basis in one place,” said Berman. People are alerted on a monthly basis regarding outstanding fines, with several different ways to pay. Motorists can use discounts if they settle their fines promptly. “The sooner you pay [the fines], the more you save,” said Berman. Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga confirmed on 15 May that her department is putting in the structures necessary to implement AARTO, including the appointment of the members of the AARTO Appeals Tribunal. Backlash Resistance to the AARTO system traces back to the introduction of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Amendment Act . The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) brought an application calling on the highest court in the land to confirm the Pretoria High Court’s 2022 judgement which found the AARTO legislation to be unconstitutional and invalid. According to OUTA, the legislation “unlawfully intrudes upon the exclusive executive and legislative competence of the local and provincial governments envisaged in the Constitution, preventing local and provincial governments from regulating their own affairs.” However, the Constitutional Court disagreed, paving the way for the rollout of the AARTO. “In a unanimous judgment written by me, the Constitutional Court has upheld the contentions advanced by the minister of transport, the Road Traffic Infringement Agency [RTIA] and the Road Traffic Management Corporation,” said Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. In response to this judgement, the Automobile Association of South Africa said, “While we naturally respect the Constitutional Court’s decision, we remain concerned that AARTO will not deliver on its intended outcomes of improving road safety and reducing road carnage on our roads.” “We stand by our previous views that the AARTO legislation is geared towards revenue collection and not on promoting safer roads,” the AA said. “Introducing legislation will not solve the country’s road safety crisis. This merely creates an impression of action while noting will change on the ground, where it is needed [and] as part of our contention, we point to the fact that there is no evidence that the AARTO pilot project saved a single life,” the AA added.

According to StatsSA’s latest report , motor trade sales for March 2024 (measured in real terms by constant 2019 prices) decreased by 10.4% year-on-year, 7% month-on-month, and 2.9% quarter-on-quarter. Key growth rates in motor trade sales at constant 2019 prices. Source: StatsSA The largest negative annual growth rates were recorded for: New vehicle sales (-23,7%); Workshop income (-14,3%); Sales of accessories (-9,9%); and Used vehicle sales (-9,3%). The largest negative contributors to the year-on-year (YoY) decrease were: New vehicle sales (contributing -6,2 percentage points); Sales of accessories (contributing -2,0 percentage points); and Used vehicle sales (contributing -1,9 percentage points). Motor trade sales at constant 2019 prices. Source: StatsSA The only type activity that saw positive YoY percentage change was income from fuel sales, which increased by 0.4%. Looking at data from Automotive Business Council, Naamsa, April 2024 saw a growth in the new vehicle market after eight consecutive months of decline. However, looking at year to date data, domestic sales sit at 168,970 (-3.96% YoY), exports sit at 105,058 (-9,09% YoY), domestic production at 137,493 (-2.29% YoY), and imports at 74,969 (-9.3% YoY). These results echo a tough 2023 for South Africa’s motor trade industry. New vehicle sales continue to take a beating in South Africa Naamsa previously said that “the country’s weak economic growth rate, although still marginally positive, remains a key challenge for the new vehicle market going forward in view of the close correlation between new vehicle sales and the GDP growth rate.” Read: Problem for South Africa’s new driving licences Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Business · 19m Tax disaster for one of South Africa’s major employers 5 Things · 2h South Africans must still use Post Office for parcels under 1kg, and SAPS in deep trouble Business · 3h Store cheaper than Checkers and Pick n Pay launches nationwide delivery Lifestyle · 17h South Africa’s top-performing private school with 4.3 distinctions per matriculant Government · 18h AGOA hope for South Africa Lifestyle · 19h 25-year-old foreigners are retiring in South Africa Industry News Partner content Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner content Do a code audit on your business software Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa More News Motoring · 20h Petrol price reality check for South African motorists Government · 22h US sends another tariff threat to South Africa Property · 23h New shopping mall opening in South Africa in two months Government · 1d Important deadline for employers in South Africa coming this week 5 Things · 1d Billionaire Motsepe’s companies seek protection from US firm, and problems for Temu orders in South Africa Media · 1d Journalism Graduates – Apply Today Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...
