Speaking at a media briefing alongside Deputy Minister Mkhuleko Hlengwa, Creecy outlined her department’s intention to amend Section 65 of the National Road Traffic Act. She highlighted that this would introduce a clear and unambiguous policy, allowing no alcohol consumption while driving. Presenting the 2025/26 festive season road safety report, covering the period from 1 December 2025 to 11 January 2026, Creecy said it was time to end the longstanding allowance that permitted drivers to consume a certain amount of alcohol before getting behind the wheel. “The time has come for us to amend the law, so that we have a clear-cut, easy-to-understand, and unambiguous policy that says drinking and driving are not allowed,” she said. “If nothing else, we owe this to the memory of the many fellow South Africans who have lost their lives on the roads.” Creecy described the current law as “totally unacceptable,” noting that existing blood-alcohol limits, set decades ago, allow regular drivers up to 0.05g per 100ml of blood and professional drivers up to 0.02g. For breathalyser tests, these limits correspond to 0.24 mg/L and 0.10 mg/L, respectively. The minister said she could not explain these allowances to families who have lost loved ones in alcohol-related crashes. The festive season report highlighted why such a change is urgently needed. While five provinces recorded reductions in road fatalities, four provinces—including Gauteng, Western Cape, Mpumalanga, and Northern Cape—saw increases. The period between 15 and 28 December accounted for over 40% of crashes and fatalities, which Creecy said confirms a trend that accidents spike when travellers have reached their destinations and are engaged in festive celebrations. Drunk driving is a problem Transport Minister Barbara Creecy and Deputy Minister Mkhuleko Hlengwa The stats also show that officers conducted 1,632 roadblocks and checked 1.8 million vehicles. Over 450,000 traffic fines were issued, while 525 motorists were arrested for excessive speeding. Creecy said roadblocks focused on vehicle roadworthiness, driver fitness, and licensing, and 173,695 drivers were tested for alcohol consumption. Of these, 8,561 tested positive, marking a 144% increase from the same period the previous year. Some of the incidents were extreme. The highest recorded blood-alcohol reading was in KwaZulu-Natal, where one driver tested 14 times above the legal limit. Meanwhile, in the Northern Cape, a motorist was caught travelling at 222 km/h in a 120 km/h zone. “This reinforces the urgent need for zero tolerance on alcohol and driving,” Creecy said. The proposed change is not new. In 2020, former Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula introduced the National Road Traffic Amendment Bill to Parliament, which included measures to eliminate blood-alcohol limits entirely in favour of a zero-tolerance approach. The bill also contained amendments to driving school regulations, licensing procedures, and traffic enforcement. However, despite parliamentary debate and consultations, the bill has not yet become law. A zero-tolerance alcohol policy for drivers would align South Africa with international best practices and remove confusion about what constitutes safe driving. If implemented, it would mean that all drivers would be prohibited from consuming any alcohol before getting behind the wheel. “I have never understood why it was acceptable to allow motorists to drink a certain amount and drive. This must end,” Creecy said. She added that the lives of South Africans on the road depend on decisive action.

However, experts warn that this relatively favourable fuel price environment may not last indefinitely. South Africa has experienced a notable decline in petrol prices at the start of 2026, and another big decrease is forecasted for February. Early data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF) points to large recoveries for both petrol and diesel, helped by the stronger rand and pressure on global oil prices. Petrol prices are showing an over-recovery of around R1.20 per litre, while diesel has an even larger recovery of around R1.75 per litre. Energy expert Roland Tatnall explained that petrol prices are mainly driven by two factors: the international price of crude oil and the rand–dollar exchange rate. At present, both are working in South Africa’s favour. Crude prices have fallen sharply over the past year, while the rand has firmed against the dollar. Tatnall noted that crude oil prices have been decreasing, adding that Brent crude is currently trading at around $60 a barrel, down from about $80 a barrel at the start of 2025. “It has decreased quite significantly over the last few months. This drop in oil prices has fed directly into lower pump prices locally,” he said. At the same time, the dollar has softened, and the rand has firmed against the dollar, amplifying the relief for consumers. As long as these two factors remain aligned, Tatnall believes fuel prices should remain broadly stable. However, he stressed that this balance is fragile. “If either one of them moves, then obviously prices will change.” One of the key risks is currency volatility. Tatnall pointed out that the rand’s quite volatile, so we don’t know where that’s going to go in the near term. Even if oil prices remain subdued, a weaker rand could quickly push fuel prices higher. Conversely, while crude prices are currently low, he questioned how sustainable this level really is. “The $56 to $60 a barrel is quite low, and there are questions on how sustainable that is,” he said. A fragile balance Energy expert Roland Tatnall Tatnall also highlighted political pressure in the US to keep oil prices down. He noted that US President Donald Trump has repeatedly spoken about wanting oil prices closer to $50 a barrel. While that could be positive for South African motorists, Tatnall doubts it is realistic. “That’s really biting off the hand that feeds him,” he said. He explained that much of US shale oil production becomes uneconomical at those levels. “Onshore shale oil has a break-even price for new wells of between $60 and $65 a barrel, so pushing the price much lower doesn’t make a lot of sense.” Beyond short-term pricing, Tatnall noted that global oil demand dynamics are also shifting, particularly due to the rise of electric vehicles. “It has already had an impact,” he said, pointing to China, where electrification has removed a million barrels of oil a day from Chinese demand. He added that in countries like Norway, around 95% of new cars sold are electric vehicles. However, Tatnall does not expect this shift to dramatically reduce oil demand in the near term. “The oil industry is not going anywhere soon,” he said. While EV adoption is growing, he argued that oil consumption of roughly 100 million barrels per day is unlikely to fall drastically over the next few years. Tatnall emphasised that while current prices are lower than they have been in a long time, motorists should not assume this is the new normal. “If either the rand or the oil price moves, prices will change.” Fuel prices may remain relatively steady if current conditions persist, but South Africans should be prepared for potential volatility.

The new vehicle market delivered a landmark performance in 2025, finally recovering above 2019 pre-pandemic levels and hitting highs not seen in a decade. The upward swing is closely tied to broader economic improvements and was boosted by a cumulative 150 basis points in interest rate cuts since September 2024, due to low inflation and an influx of affordable model imports. Naamsa said that the new vehicle market concluded the year on a strong note in December 2025, with aggregate industry new vehicle sales reaching 48,983 units, a year-on-year increase of 7,882 vehicles. The December 2025 new passenger car market demonstrated a robust performance, with a year-on-year volume increase of 20.3%, while light commercial vehicles experienced a gain of 23.7%. However, truck and bus sales ended the year on a weaker note, with medium commercial vehicles decreasing year-on-year by 7.0%, while heavy trucks and buses decreased year-on-year by 13.2%. Upon examining the details, Toyota remained the largest seller, with 12,933 vehicles sold in December 2025. This was followed by Volkswagen (5,014) and Suzuki (4,961). While the rest of the top ten is comprised of cars from established brands, including Ford and Kia, there is a rise of Chinese brands, such as GWM and Chery. Chinese brands have been consistently outpacing their European rivals in sales growth in South Africa for some time. However, the Indian brand, Mahindra, has also been selling more cars. In December 2025, Mahindra sold 1,234 vehicles, making it the 13th largest vehicle seller in South Africa. The company sold more cars than Nissan, which sold 1,011 units. This was well ahead of BMW, which sold 843 vehicles over the period. It also sold more than Stellantis, which houses several major brands, including Jeep and Opel, which sold 524 units. Associated with high-end luxury, Mercedes-Benz sold an estimated 474 units during the final month of the year. While ranking 13th in December, Mahindra has consistently been among the top-10 sellers throughout the year, ranking 10th when considering data for the full year. Although Mahindra has been present in South Africa for two decades, the Indian company has aggressively expanded its market share in recent years. Its models are primarily small SUVs and bakkies. The company recently opened a R70 million vehicle assembly facility in Durban at the Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone.

Declining sales in China’s domestic vehicle sales are expected to drive a continued “Affordability Influx” as its manufacturers look outward for growth. Although the US economy presents uncertainties for exporters, the industry remains focused on securing its position in the EU, which is easily the most important export regional destination.

BusinessTech travelled on the bullet train, known as the “Shinkansen” in Japan, from Tokyo to Osaka and back again in December, and was thoroughly impressed. From start to finish, the journey was flawless and pleasant. It started with the train stations, which are far from a place to simply board a train. Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station are best described as expansive shopping centres that also serve as a place for hundreds of thousands of people to board trains each day. The stations are clean, modern, and packed with a wide range of stores. Once we entered the stations and went through our respective gates, we were greeted by restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, and general retailers. This included international brands like Starbucks and local brands such as the renowned 551 Horai. All the stores were busy with customers, but the service was quick and efficient, meaning wait times were not excessive. We purchased a tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlets) bento box for the trip, and made our way to the platform. The stations have clear markings and signage throughout, with almost all of it displayed in both Japanese and English, or switching between the two languages regularly. If you do not speak or read Japanese, you should have no issues finding your way through the stations to your train. Once on the correct platform, you get to see the bullet train in its full glory while it waits for passengers to board. We rode on the Nozomi train service on both legs of our journey, which uses an N700 series bullet train. This is the fastest option, taking a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes to travel from Tokyo to Osaka. The return trip is a similar duration. For comparison, driving from Tokyo to Osaka is a 500km journey, which Google Maps estimates takes between 5 and 8 hours to complete. The Nozomi bullet train can travel so quickly between the two cities thanks to: A top operational speed of 300km/h. It only stops at a few stations along the way, for a couple of minutes each time. The tracks for the bullet train are prioritised for its journey, meaning no disruptions or “traffic”. In true Japanese style, our bullet train arrived well ahead of its scheduled departure time, and the passengers disembarked. A cleaning crew, waiting on the platform, then sprang into action and hurried onto the train with their equipment to clean it. Within a few minutes, they were done, and we were instructed to board the train. This is another hallmark of the platforms at Japanese train stations: announcements, chimes, and warnings play constantly. If you miss a train, it is almost certainly your own fault. We purchased “Green Car” reserved seating for our trips, which is equivalent to first-class on the bullet train. This gives you a specific seat in a particular car on the train, as pictured above, which was large and comfortable. The seats can also decline and feature an adjustable footrest in front of you. For larger groups, a row of seats can be rotated 180 degrees to face the row of seats behind it. This allows for a group of four passengers to face each other. The total price for our tickets was 77,160 Yen (R8,100) – which covered two people on a Tokyo-Osaka round-trip. This works out to just over R2,000 per person for each leg of the trip. Cheaper seat options are available, and two people can take the same journey in a “normal” part of the train for 57,000 Yen (R6,000). The ride on the train was superb. It floated across the tracks at a rapid speed, and the journey was extremely comfortable. Once we departed, a bullet train employee walked down the aisle, handing out wet wipes to all passengers. The same employee made multiple trips up and down the aisle throughout the journey, smiling as she carried a large packet and asked if we had any rubbish we wanted to throw away. Riding across Japan also gave us a chance to see a wide range of scenery—from dense housing to large office buildings to expansive open fields. The facilities on the bullet train are equally impressive. There was a space for large suitcases at the back of our car, charging ports in our seats, and a bathroom which was clean and private. For those who have not visited Japan before, an entire article can be dedicated to their toilets. They provide a range of functions at the touch of a button – including washing and drying your business end, without you having to leave the seat. Getting off the train at your destination is as easy as getting on. You walk through a gate which scans your ticket and are greeted by more train lines, subway lines, shops, restaurants, and stores. South Africa’s bullet train A bullet train is not a new concept to South Africans, as the government has long been discussing the development of one in the country. A high-speed rail framework was first discussed in 2010 under the former Transport Minister, Sibusiso Ndebele, and was again promoted by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2019. More recently, in 2023, the “Limpopo-Gauteng Speed Train Project” was announced. The project then entered a feasibility study and environmental impact assessment in mid-2025. The expected launch of this bullet train is scheduled for 2030, and it is being led by the Department of Transport, in collaboration with the Gauteng and Limpopo provincial governments, as well as private investors. However, a bullet train requires a highly secure and functional railway system due to the fast speeds of the trains and the second-perfect schedules they run on. This is a challenge in South Africa, as the country’s railway systems are run by state-owned entities Transnet and PRASA, which have historically underperformed. Years of underinvestment and corruption have hindered Transnet’s ability to provide freight services across the country, while PRASA has struggled similarly in the passenger rail sector . The security of people using public transport in South Africa is another major issue to solve. Violence between taxi drivers and e-hailing drivers—such as Uber—has left people scared to use either service. Ubers and taxis would be needed to get from one’s home to a train station for long journeys. Attacks on trains in South Africa have also left commuters stranded in the past. This includes a massive arson attack in Cape Town in 2019 , where 18 train carriages were gutted. For a bullet train to operate at a world-class level in South Africa, these challenges must be addressed first.

Stellantis South Africa stated that the local recall aligns with a global recall campaign. It affects its Citroën, DS, Chrysler, Jeep, Opel, and legacy Chevrolet models. It warned that driving with an unrepaired Takata airbag poses a severe risk of injury or death. Stellantis is not the only manufacturer to have recalled vehicles due to the issues; Ford, Toyota, Honda, and BMW have also done so. The problem has resulted in the largest vehicle recall in history. Toyota stated that the recall is due to the discovery of a potential issue with certain types of airbag inflators manufactured by Takata, which may allow moisture intrusion over time. This could create excessive internal pressure when the airbag is deployed, causing the inflator to rupture. In the event of an inflator rupture, metal fragments could pass through the airbag cushion material, striking and possibly injuring occupants in the event of an accident. In South Africa, no injuries or fatalities have been reported due to this condition. Stellantis South Africa said that it has proactively contacted customers for several years and replaced defective Takata airbag inflators. Although it states that significant progress has been made, some vehicles remain unrepaired, and the Stop-Drive warning continues to be in effect. It has urged customers whose airbags have not yet been replaced to immediately stop driving their vehicles and arrange a free repair at an authorised service centre. All replacement work is then carried out at authorised service centres at no cost to customers. The affected vehicles can be found below: Citroën Citroën C3 Phase 2 (2008-2017) Citroën C4 (2010-2018) Citroën DS3 (2008-2019) Citroën DS4 (2010-2017) Citroën DS5 (2010-2018) Citroën C Zéro (2010-2017) DS DS 3 (2008-2019) DS 4 (2010-2017) DS 5 (2010-2018) Chrysler Chrysler 300 (2004-2016) Chrysler Aspen (2007-2009) Chrysler Crossfire (2007-2008) Jeep Jeep Wrangler (2007-2016) Opel Opel Astra (2005-2014) Opel Cascada (2012-2018) Opel Meriva (2009-2017) Opel Mokka (2011-2018) Opel Vectra (2003-2008) Opel Zafira (2011-2016) Opel Astra 10 (2009-2018) Opel Signum (2005-2008) Chevrolet Chevrolet Cruze (2009-2017) Chevrolet Orlando (2011-2017) Chevrolet Aveo (2011-2018) Chevrolet SPARK Chevrolet VIVA Customers can check if their vehicle is affected by visiting their car’s manufacturer’s website and entering their vehicle’s VIN in the relevant portal.

Chinese brands, in particular, have been entering South Africa at a rapid pace over the past few years, and 2025 followed this trend closely, with six manufacturers from the People’s Republic making their local debut. The only exception was Tata Motors, which marked a high-profile return to South Africa’s passenger car segment after an extended absence. According to data from vehicle analytics firm Lightstone, these launches are part of a broader shift in South Africa’s vehicle sales landscape. New brands—mostly Chinese—are steadily increasing their market share, while traditional players are being forced to rethink their strategies to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. Lightstone’s data showed that in 2000, the top six selling light vehicle brands in South Africa were Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Opel, Mazda and Ford. Together, they controlled between 60% and 70% of the market for much of the following decade. Between 2010 and 2020, that figure dropped to between 50% and 60%, before settling at around 50% from 2020 to 2023. By 2024, however, their combined market share fell below 50%, a level it has yet to recover. “New brands such as Chery, Omoda, Jetour, JAC and Beijing have steadily grown from just 0.5% in 2022 Q2 to 10% in the two most recent quarters of 2025,” said Andrew Hibbert, Data Analyst at Lightstone Auto. “These new entrants offer modern tech, competitive pricing and long warranties, helping them move from niche to mainstream.” “This is highlighted by the fact that Chery’s 2025 market share alone exceeds the combined share of Nissan, Mazda, and Opel.” Hibbert added that shifts are also evident among traditional brands. While Toyota, Volkswagen and Ford remain in the top six, Suzuki, Isuzu and Renault have replaced Nissan, Opel and Mazda among the country’s strongest sellers compared to those reporting sales in 2000. The new car brands that launched Against this backdrop, 2025’s new brand launches arrived with a wide variety of products and technologies. The first to enter the market was MG, which launched at the start of the year with three vehicles. These included the ZS crossover, the HS SUV, and the all-electric Cyberster roadster. MG has since expanded its range with the MG3 hatchback and the ZS Pro crossover, broadening its appeal across multiple segments. Tata Motors officially re-entered South Africa’s passenger car market in August with four new models showcasing the brand’s latest design language. Its initial lineup includes the Tiago hatchback, Punch crossover, Curvv crossover coupe, and the Harrier midsize SUV, marking a renewed push into the local market. Another notable arrival was Leapmotor, which stands out from other Chinese brands due to its affiliation with Stellantis, the global automotive group behind Opel, Peugeot, Citroën, Jeep and Alfa Romeo. Leapmotor vehicles are distributed through the existing Stellantis dealer network in South Africa. For now, it offers a single model, the C10 family SUV, which uses a range-extended electric vehicle powertrain. In this setup, a petrol engine acts solely as a generator, charging a battery that powers the electric motors driving the wheels. Changan and its new-energy sub-brand Deepal arrived in late October with four models. Changan launched the Alsvin sedan, CS75 Pro SUV and Hunter bakkie, while Deepal introduced the S07 electric crossover. The Hunter REEV bakkie added another electrified option to South Africa’s growing alternative-energy lineup. Shortly thereafter, Geely entered the market with two SUVs. These are the fully electric E5 and the plug-in hybrid E5 EM-i. These models represent only the first phase of Geely’s plans, with the company also intending to introduce its Zeekr, Farizon and Riddara sub-brands locally in the near future. Rounding out the year was Dongfeng, which made its South African debut in November with the electric Box hatchback. The brand has also confirmed plans to launch the 007 sedan and the 06 SUV, further adding to the expanding selection of new vehicles competing for local buyers’ attention. The seven car brands that launched in South Africa in 2025 are listed below.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/845732/discovery-sends-hijacking-warning-to-motorists-in-south-africa/,2026-01-17T15:54:57+00:00,,Discovery sends hijacking warning to motorists in South Africa,,"Motoring Luke Fraser 20 Dec 2025 Motoring Discovery sends hijacking warning to motorists in South Africa Luke Fraser · 20 Dec 2025 Discovery Insure has highlighted the scourge of hijacking in the final months of the year and has warned South Africans to check that their trackers are working. The company stated that vehicle tracking devices are crucial for recovering stolen vehicles, but they can also impact insurance coverage. Many insurance policies require a tracking device to help reduce risk; however, they must be correctly installed and in working order to ensure the coverage is valid. The small gadgets are more than just a theft deterrent; they also have a significant impact on one’s vehicle insurance coverage. SAPS data showed that 86 vehicles were stolen per day between January and March 2025. Discovery Insure’s data show that while overall vehicle theft and hijacking have declined over the past two years, vehicle-related crime still tends to rise toward the end of the year. In November and December, incidents typically increase by roughly 10% compared to the rest of the year. This means tracking devices are a critical line of defence against theft year-round, and especially during the festive season. “Having a functioning tracking device in your vehicle improves the chances of it being recovered, said Precious Nduli, Chief Commercial Officer of Discovery Insure. “This lowers your risk profile as a driver and reduces the expected cost of claims, which can make your premium more affordable. Without a tracker, Nduli said that the risk might be too high for insurers to offer coverage at all, which is why many insurers need one for coverage, especially for high-value or high-risk vehicles. How a tracker affects you Discovery Insure stated that if you don’t install the device via an approved provider within a specified timeframe, your vehicle may not be covered for theft or hijacking. This condition often applies to high-value vehicles, such as luxury cars and SUVs, which are at a high risk of theft, as well as commercial or fleet vehicles. An insurer may even require more than one tracker to be installed in a vehicle if it’s deemed particularly high-risk. “If your car is stolen, the tracking device is essential for recovery”, said Nduli. “Without it, especially if your insurer has made it a prerequisite, your cover could be limited to basic third-party insurance or future claims rejected.” Tracking devices also come with additional features that benefit the driver, such as an immediate emergency response trigger. Tracking devices are also only designed to last between 18 months and two years before they need to be replaced. They can also deplete sooner if the driving profile is more aggressive, the installation is poor, or the device is damaged. “Contact your insurance provider to understand how to test if your device is not working. Some insurers will also notify you if they detect that your device is not working,” said Nduli. “If you have a third-party tracker, make sure that your subscriptions are up to date.” If you believe there is an issue, it is best to contact your insurer as soon as possible, as a delay can affect your coverage. Discovery Insure has highlighted the increased risk of hijacking in the final months of the year, and has warned motorists to check their trackers.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/846572/warning-to-anyone-with-unpaid-fines-in-south-africa/,2026-01-17T15:55:01+00:00,,Warning to anyone with unpaid fines in South Africa,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 20 Dec 2025 Motoring Warning to anyone with unpaid fines in South Africa Malcolm Libera · 20 Dec 2025 South African motorists are being urged to stay alert over the busy festive season, as criminals increasingly exploit unpaid fines and heightened travel activity to scam and intimidate road users. With more vehicles on the road and law enforcement visibility increasing at roadblocks and border posts, fraudsters are using fear and urgency to extract money and personal information from unsuspecting motorists. Fines SA has issued a warning about a surge in fraudulent SMS and WhatsApp messages claiming motorists have outstanding traffic fines that require immediate payment. According to the company, it has seen a sharp rise in consumer queries from people unsure whether these messages are legitimate, as the scams are becoming more convincing and widespread. The messages warn recipients that they face penalties, legal action, or arrest if they do not settle an alleged fine immediately. They often include a link to what appears to be a legitimate payment page, carefully designed to mimic official municipal or traffic fine platforms. In reality, these sites are cloned pages controlled by criminals, and any money paid is diverted straight to fraudsters. Fines SA stressed that it does not send traffic fine notifications via SMS. Its CEO, Barry Berman, told BusinessTech that the company has seen a noticeable spike in motorists contacting them to verify messages they have received. He explained that the scams are deliberately designed to create panic, pushing people to act quickly without verifying the information. Once a payment is made on an unsafe site, the money is gone, and no fine has actually been settled, leaving the motorist both out of pocket and still liable for any legitimate fines. One of the clearest warning signs is the web address. Any link that does not direct users to www.finessa.co.za is not associated with Fines SA. Payments made on fake sites expose motorists not only to financial loss but also to potential identity theft, as personal and banking details are often harvested for further criminal activity. The company advised motorists to treat any unsolicited fine-related message with extreme caution. Syndicates are taking advantage of increased police presence Rather than clicking on links or reacting to threats, drivers are encouraged to stop and independently verify their fine status through secure and trusted platforms. Berman added that taking a few minutes to check through a verified source can prevent unnecessary stress and significant financial loss. The warning comes as legal experts also caution that the festive season creates ideal conditions for other types of road-related scams. Ann-Suhet Marx, Director and Head of Litigation at law firm VDM Incorporated, said criminals often take advantage of increased enforcement and travel congestion during this time of year. While legitimate law enforcement operations are being stepped up at roadblocks and border posts, syndicates exploit the confusion by posing as officials or service providers to extort cash from travellers. Marx warned that not every uniform is legitimate and that criminals thrive on fear and uncertainty. Fraudsters posing as traffic officers may demand so-called “spot fines” for minor issues such as cracked windscreens, worn tyres, or expired licence discs. These demands are often accompanied by threats of detention or vehicle impoundment unless cash is paid immediately. Spot fines are illegal, and motorists cannot be forced to pay cash at a roadblock. Drivers have the right to insist on written documentation and to verify any fine through official channels. There is also a growing risk of identity theft, with syndicates requesting copies of licences or passports under false pretences, or even asking motorists to hand over original documents. Marx advised travellers never to surrender originals unless legally required and to keep certified copies available for routine checks, while safeguarding original documents at all times.

Early 2024 started with a handful of discontinuations, which turned into a major shift by the end of 2025. Familiar models quietly disappeared from showrooms, and manufacturers moved toward newer, more efficient, or more profitable vehicles. The early wave of withdrawals included several well-known cars. Subaru replaced the VX with the Crosstrek, and Kia ended production of the Rio for all right-hand-drive markets, which meant its exit from South Africa. Citroën dropped its European-built C3 and C3 Aircross and replaced them with Indian-made versions that share the same names but are completely different cars. Honda also retired the WR-V and introduced the Elevate in its place, in line with the growing demand for compact SUVs. Mahindra made a similar move by discontinuing the XUV300 and introducing the newer XUV300 TurboSport. Volkswagen discontinued its entry-level Amarok bakkie, signalling a shift in focus for its commercial lineup. Other models were discontinued due to slowing sales. Hyundai dropped the Kona, Nissan removed the Qashqai, Jeep ended the Renegade, Mazda discontinued the BT-50, and Toyota phased out the C-HR. The Nissan NP200, one of the best-selling small bakkies in the country, was discontinued because its ageing engineering could no longer keep up with modern standards. Suzuki also removed the Vitara, saying its newer Fronx and Grand Vitara already filled that space in the SUV market. The pace of changes picked up sharply in 2025, with at least 16 more models being discontinued. While many of these decisions were driven by low demand, others were tied to major global shifts in the industry—especially the shift toward electric vehicles and simplified product ranges. Jaguar made the most dramatic move. In late 2024, it announced a complete shift to electric cars as part of a major rebrand. Big exit from Ford It then stopped building all its petrol and diesel models, including the popular E-Pace and F-Type. The company has already shown off its first new concept, the Type 00, but for now, Jaguar has no new cars on sale in South Africa. Its parent company still operates locally through the Land Rover and Range Rover brands. Maserati took a similar step, removing the Ghibli, Levante, and Quattroporte from its South African lineup as it prepares to introduce future electric models. Audi continued trimming its global range, discontinuing the A4 in 2025 and replacing it with the new-generation A5. The A1 and Q2 will also be cut in 2026 as the company simplifies its offerings. Fiat discontinued the Tipo, consistent with its small footprint in South Africa. Ford dropped the Puma even though it was well-reviewed, because it was considered too expensive to compete effectively. With its removal, Ford’s only locally available passenger vehicle is the Territory SUV, alongside its strong-selling Ranger and Everest. Honda also discontinued the Ballade and BR-V in 2025, while Lexus ended the RC. Toyota made two noteworthy cuts this year, which are the Corolla Quest and the Land Cruiser 79 V8. The Quest, once one of the most affordable sedans on the market, fell victim to declining interest in sedans as more South Africans choose crossovers and SUVs. The Land Cruiser 79 lost its iconic 4.5-litre V8 turbodiesel after Toyota shifted globally to more efficient engines, leaving Toyota with no V8 models in South Africa. The 28 cars that have been discontinued in South Africa over the course of two years are listed below. 2024 Citroen C3 Citroen C3 Aircross Honda WR-V Hyundai Kona Jeep Renegade Mahindra XUV300 Mazda BT-50 Nissan Qashqai Suzuki Vitara Toyota C-HR VW Amarok 110kW Nissan NP200 2025 Audi A4 Fiat Tipo Ford Puma Honda Ballade Honda BR-V Jaguar E-Pace Jaguar F-Type Jaguar I-Pace Jaguar XE Jaguar XF Lexus RC Maserati Ghibli Maserati Levante Maserati Quattroporte Toyota Corolla Quest Toyota Land Cruiser 79 V8 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Energy · 3h Great news about petrol prices in January Wealth · 5h Discover Cyprus: A Premier Destination for Investment, Wealth Management, and Lifestyle Lifestyle · 6h The South African city voted one of the best in the world for food 5 Things · 8h US sends a threat to South Africa, and bad start for people with DStv in South Africa Government · 9h Ramaphosa waiting to sign 7 new laws for South Africa Business · 1d End of the line for 126 more businesses in South Africa Industry News Partner content Six ways to refresh your finances this festive season Partner content BusinessTech reviews – The best way to promote new products Partner content BusinessTech – Reach 5 million South Africans in one place Partner content Codehesion – South Africa’s leading Android and iOS app development company Partner content Business Talk reaches 8 million views Partner content What your board of directors should know about King V More News Energy · 18 Dec 2025 69 cents per litre pain for drivers in South Africa Government · 18 Dec 2025 Another state monopoly in South Africa comes crashing down 5 Things · 18 Dec 2025 US firm after billionaire Motsepe’s companies for R3.2 billion, and end of Post Office’s monopoly on small parcel deliveries Lifestyle · 18 Dec 2025 Warning to people visiting shopping malls in South Africa Property · 17 Dec 2025 Goodbye Cape Town – the small towns South Africans are moving to instead Business · 17 Dec 2025 Iconic 100-year-old South African company finding a new home Poll Do you anticipate a pay hike next year?

As prices soar well above inflation, the affordability of the cheapest models from Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz now requires buyers to be in the upper-income brackets. According to the latest TransUnion Mobility Insights Report, the cost of new vehicles rose only slightly in the third quarter of 2025. This index, which tracks pricing trends for new and used vehicles from 15 top-volume manufacturers, showed a 1.5% year-on-year increase in new car prices during this period. While all vehicle segments experienced price hikes, hatchbacks saw the lowest increase, with a 0.7% rise compared to last year. Despite this, over a longer period, hatchbacks—often the entry-level models for luxury brands—have seen the steepest price increases. This is evident in the cost of the Audi A1, BMW 1 Series, and Mercedes-Benz A-Class. The Audi A1, currently the most affordable option among the three, is priced at R530,900. 10 years ago, the same vehicle cost R265,000, which means the price of the model has increased by R265,900 (100%). The BMW 1 Series follows at R713,395, while the Mercedes-Benz A-Class tops the list at R813,124. These prices reflect price increases of R371,395 (109%) and R423,924 (109%), respectively, compared to 2015. These figures highlight how much the landscape of vehicle affordability has shifted, with over 75% of all cars in South Africa now costing more than R500,000. Several factors contribute to these rising costs. The weak rand and a sluggish local economy have made it increasingly expensive to import and sell vehicles in South Africa. This has had a profound impact on sales for premium brands. Over the past decade, combined sales for Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz have plummeted by 63.5% since 2014. At the same time, competitors from other markets, particularly China, have gained traction by offering competitive pricing, advanced technology, and solid build quality, reshaping the market dynamics. What you need to earn The affordability challenge becomes even starker when considering the financial commitment required to own one of these vehicles. Using the Audi A1 as an example, financing the car over 60 months at an 11.50% lending rate (prime rate of 10.25% plus 1.25%) with no deposit would result in a monthly instalment of approximately R11,771. Financial experts advise that car payments should not exceed 25% of your monthly income. By this standard, you would need to earn at least R47,100 per month to comfortably afford this vehicle. To put this into perspective, data from the World Inequality Database indicates that earning R47,100 places you among South Africa’s top 10% of income earners. This means 90% of South Africans earn less than this threshold, underscoring the exclusivity of owning even the cheapest models from these premium brands. The cheapest Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are listed below, along with the starting price, estimated monthly instalment, and monthly salary required to afford the vehicle. Audi A1 Starting price: R530,900 Monthly instalment: R11,771 Estimated monthly salary required: R47,100 BMW 1 Series Starting price: R713,395 Monthly instalment: R15,785 Estimated monthly salary required: R63,200 Mercedes-Benz A-Class Starting price: R813,124 Monthly instalment: R17,978 Estimated monthly salary required: R71,900 Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Motoring · 2h Warning to anyone with unpaid fines in South Africa Motoring · 17h South Africa kissed these 28 cars goodbye Energy · 20h Great news about petrol prices in January Wealth · 21h Discover Cyprus: A Premier Destination for Investment, Wealth Management, and Lifestyle Lifestyle · 23h The South African city voted one of the best in the world for food 5 Things · 1d US sends a threat to South Africa, and bad start for people with DStv in South Africa Industry News Partner content 15 years of leading smartphone camera technology – A history of Galaxy camera innovation Partner content Six ways to refresh your finances this festive season Partner content BusinessTech reviews – The best way to promote new products Partner content BusinessTech – Reach 5 million South Africans in one place Partner content Codehesion – South Africa’s leading Android and iOS app development company Partner content Business Talk reaches 8 million views More News Government · 1d Ramaphosa waiting to sign 7 new laws for South Africa Business · 18 Dec 2025 End of the line for 126 more businesses in South Africa Energy · 18 Dec 2025 69 cents per litre pain for drivers in South Africa Government · 18 Dec 2025 Another state monopoly in South Africa comes crashing down 5 Things · 18 Dec 2025 US firm after billionaire Motsepe’s companies for R3.2 billion, and end of Post Office’s monopoly on small parcel deliveries Lifestyle · 18 Dec 2025 Warning to people visiting shopping malls in South Africa Poll Do you anticipate a pay hike next year?

With holiday traffic already building, the government has launched extensive safety campaigns aimed at reducing the high number of fatalities typically recorded during the month of December and early January. In Johannesburg, the City’s Public Safety Department has launched its 2025 Festive Season Safety Campaign, which will run from 1 December 2025 to mid-January 2026. The initiative is designed as both a warning and an appeal to road users. With 5.5 million registered vehicles in Gauteng alone, the risk on the province’s highways and streets continues to increase. Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Kedibone Diale-Tlabela said the numbers speak for themselves. There are more cars, more movement, and more people travelling. This means more opportunities for accidents, especially involving pedestrians. She stressed that enforcement will be coordinated and uncompromising, adding that lawbreakers should expect consequences. “All law enforcement agencies are collaborating and working together, and we’ll make sure that people are safe. We will arrest you,” she warned. Pedestrian deaths remain one of the most troubling concerns, accounting for more than half of Gauteng’s road fatalities. This reality has placed additional urgency on the campaign led by MMC for Public Safety Mgcini Tshwaku, JMPD Commissioner Patrick Jaca, and Emergency Management Services Chief Andries Macuvele. Tshwaku said residents should expect high-density patrols and roadblocks across every region, day and night. The City is adopting a zero-tolerance stance on drinking and driving, unroadworthy vehicles, cellphone use while driving, expired discs and licences, and failure to wear seatbelts. Joint operations involving JMPD, EMS, and other enforcement units will be deployed around the clock, supported by thousands of officers. The city will also run 24/7 “smart roadblocks,” where motorists can pay outstanding fines on-site. What they’ll be looking for The national government is echoing these measures. Transport Minister Barbara Creecy has urged all road users to take the surge in traffic seriously ahead of the Christmas and New Year long weekends. She revealed that more than 10,000 people have lost their lives on South Africa’s roads in 2024, with most crashes occurring late at night or in the early hours of the morning—especially over weekends. In response, 24/7 traffic policing will be intensified on high-risk routes throughout the festive season. Officers will focus on speed enforcement, vehicle inspections, and drunk-driving arrests, while border posts will see additional deployments as cross-border traffic increases. Creecy said national, provincial, and municipal authorities, together with the Road Traffic Management Corporation, are working closely to ensure strict enforcement. Historically, the Department of Transport has targeted vehicles with severe defects, and this year the approach will be even tougher. Any vehicle found with three or more critical faults—such as leaking engine oil, defective lights, faulty brakes, worn tyres, cracked windscreens, or expired licences—will be immediately impounded. The City of Johannesburg said its goal is to ensure a “safe, orderly, and enjoyable festive season” for residents and visitors. The Western Cape has also launched its own extensive festive-season plan, unveiled at an event in Beaufort West—one of the province’s busiest transit corridors. More than 600 provincial officers and over 300 patrol vehicles will be deployed across the province. This will be supported by high-visibility patrols, around-the-clock staffing, mobile vehicle-testing units, evidentiary breath-testing centres for alcohol enforcement, and pedestrian safety operations in high-risk areas. Authorities will focus on reducing speeding, distracted driving, reckless behaviour, and driver fatigue on long-distance routes such as the N1, N2, and N7. The Western Cape Government stated that it intends to work tirelessly to keep roads safe and ensure that families can reach their holiday destinations without harm.

Transport Minister Barbara Creecy launched the 365-day Arrive Alive Road Safety Campaign at the beginning of December, and stressed that safer roads rely on the choices made by drivers, passengers and pedestrians. She emphasised that most road crashes in South Africa are not accidents in the true sense of the word—they are preventable and overwhelmingly linked to human behaviour. Creecy urged South Africans to take personal responsibility as the busiest travel period of the year begins. She added that this year marks a meaningful milestone: for the first time in five years, the national road death toll has declined by 700 people. However, South Africa still recorded more than 9,400 fatalities so far this year, a number she described as “much, much too high”. Evidence collected throughout the year shows that human error accounts for nine out of ten accidents, with Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Limpopo responsible for most fatal crashes. Pedestrians remain the most vulnerable group, accounting for more than half of road deaths. For this reason, the campaign will intensify behaviour-change programmes, run extensive public awareness drives, and increase law enforcement visibility, including 24-hour patrols in high-risk corridors. Weekend travel, late-night driving and long stretches where fatigue sets in remain the most dangerous periods on South Africa’s roads. Roadblocks will be stepped up, with authorities focusing on roadworthiness, licenses, seatbelt and child-restraint use, and aggressive action against speeding and drunk driving. The Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) told BusinessTech that it is essential that discussions about dangerous roads are grounded in verified data. Most dangerous roads Official statistics provide the clearest picture of accident trends and high-risk routes, particularly during the festive season when traffic volumes surge. According to the Department of Transport and recent road-safety reports, several national and provincial roads consistently emerge as the country’s most dangerous. The most dangerous roads, as outlined by the AA, are: N1 (Pretoria to Polokwane, Cape Town to Johannesburg) : Heavy traffic volumes and reckless overtaking make this route a hotspot for collisions. N2 (Cape Town to Durban, especially KwaZulu-Natal) : One of the busiest highways in the country, plagued by speeding, drunk driving, and pedestrian activity. N3 (Johannesburg to Durban) : A key holiday route to the coast, often congested with trucks and long-distance buses. N4 (Pretoria to Mpumalanga and Mozambique) : Popular with tourists heading to Kruger National Park and cross-border travellers, with fatigue and speeding as major risks. N12 (Johannesburg to Kimberley) : An alternative to the N1/N3, but long stretches without enforcement make it hazardous. Provincial roads such as the R61 (Eastern Cape) and R71 (Limpopo) : Poor road conditions and mixed traffic (cars, taxis, buses) contribute to high accident rates. Naked Insurance co-founder Ernest North told BusinessTech that its claims data also reflects a small but notable increase in car accident claims in December and January. Long-distance routes linking inland provinces with coastal towns see the biggest spike. This mirrors government data and reflects a familiar pattern: fatigued drivers, heavy holiday traffic, unfamiliar drivers negotiating new routes, and deteriorating road conditions all combine to raise the risks. Urban roads, by contrast, experience more stable accident patterns. As holiday travel picks up, road safety experts and insurers offer several practical guidelines. Drivers should maintain awareness at all times by keeping a safe following distance, scanning mirrors and steering clear of visibly risky drivers. Alcohol and driving should never mix, as even small amounts impair reaction times. Speed limits must be obeyed and adjusted for traffic, weather and potholes. Before any long trip, a basic vehicle check is vital. Fatigue is a silent killer, making scheduled breaks every two hours essential. Overloading vehicles compromises control and braking, while seatbelts—and proper child restraints—remain non-negotiable. Travellers should also plan their routes carefully, avoiding damaged roads, peak congestion and severe weather when possible.

This was revealed in Press Pulse’s latest report, which tracked media sentiment across South Africa’s top business and motoring publications. Ford’s poor media sentiment is not unexpected. Recent developments have raised concerns from owners about safety. In July 2025, Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa announced a recall campaign that affected more than 5,700 vehicles in South Africa. A month later, the company issued another recall campaign affecting over 20,000 vehicles, including the Ranger, EcoSport, and Everest. One of the issues related to the infotainment screen freezing or turning black, which can cause the rear-view camera image to be frozen, missing, or delayed while reversing. Some Ford Ranger models were recalled due to a potential temporary loss of brake boost, requiring increased pedal effort. Soon after the recalls, the company’s South African division announced that it would be retrenching hundreds of workers. Ford explained that these retrenchments were linked to lower European orders for its Ranger pickup truck, driven by recent tax changes in the UK. Media coverage highlighted the concern from trade unions, including Solidarity, and analysts that this move signals structural fragility. Another issue which has been haunting the car brand for many years is the Ford Kuga fire crisis, which made headlines a decade ago. Despite happening so long ago, the Ford Kuga problem continues to be found in articles about the company in 2025. These issues compounded to make Ford the only top car brand in South Africa with a negative media sentiment rating over the last three months. The chart below shows Press Pulse’s media sentiment ranking for Ford, Toyota, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and Suzuki. About Press Pulse Press Pulse developed an artificial intelligence (AI) sentiment-measuring system for online media reports. The system focuses on South African business reporting from top-tier media publications and measures companies’ success in achieving positive exposure. The sentiment ranking is based on the number of positive, neutral, or negative articles and the reach and influence of the publication where they are published. Simply put, the more positive articles a company receives, the better its sentiment ranking. The inverse also holds. Online media in South Africa is highly influential, which is why companies invest heavily in public relations and content marketing to get positive exposure. However, before Press Pulse’s new sentiment system, it was difficult for companies to track their performance accurately. The good news is that new advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to measure media sentiment objectively. The system uses natural language processing and deep learning for accurate sentiment detection. Press Pulse makes it easy for companies to track their online media sentiment and gain insight into how they can improve.

The latest South African Police Service (SAPS) crime statistics recorded 4,533 hijackings in the most recent three-month period. Although this reflects a 15.1% year-on-year decline, the numbers are still worryingly high. The SAPS currently sees about 50 cases of hijackings every day. Using data from police, security companies, and major insurance and tracking firms, MoneyToday published a list of the most stolen cars for 2025. According to MoneyToday, the cars most commonly targeted are: Toyota Hilux Volkswagen Polo Vivo Toyota Fortuner Ford Ranger Hyundai H100 Nissan NP200, Kia Picanto Toyota Corolla Cross Isuzu D-Max BMW 3 Series. Many of these models have appeared on hijacking lists for years. The Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, and Nissan NP200 are popular workhorse vehicles with high resale value, making them consistently attractive to criminals. The Volkswagen Polo Vivo is one of South Africa’s most widely driven cars, and its parts are always in high demand. The Toyota Fortuner has also been a favourite among syndicates because it is easy to resell or strip for components. What is new this year is the appearance of the Kia Picanto, Isuzu D-Max, and Toyota Corolla Cross. Security company Blue Hawk Tactical warned in September that a criminal group had been specifically targeting Corolla Cross vehicles across Gauteng for several months. Wahl Bartmann, CEO of Fidelity Services Group, previously told BusinessTech that criminals prefer cars that “blend in” and can move through traffic without drawing attention. He said vehicles like the Corolla Cross, especially in common colours such as white or silver, are appealing because they are popular and easy to hide among everyday traffic. Once stolen, the cars are either stripped for parts or illegally re-registered and sold. The latest trends and how to avoid becoming a target Since its launch in 2021, the Corolla Cross has become one of the top-selling vehicles in the country, frequently ranking among the top four best-selling cars in 2025. The popularity of these vehicles is a major factor in why they are targeted. Naamsa’s sales data shows that most cars on the list rank among the best-selling models in South Africa. High sales mean high demand for parts, and this creates opportunities for criminal networks involved in chop shops and illegal vehicle sales. MoneyToday noted that vehicles on the most-stolen list typically face higher insurance premiums. Drivers of these cars often pay 15% to 30% more for insurance and may be required to install tracking units or other security devices before their policy is approved. However, while these ten cars are the most frequently targeted, no vehicle is completely safe. The number of hijackings involving a specific model should always be considered alongside how many of those cars are on the road. In other words, a car may appear frequently in hijacking statistics simply because there are many of them in circulation. Bartmann told BusinessTech that overall hijacking numbers have remained relatively stable in recent months. There was a slight decline from August to September, followed by a small increase in October 2025. Looking at past trends, he stressed that hijackings usually rise in November before dropping again in December, and he warned that this pattern might repeat this year. He also reported a new tactic used by criminals. In some areas of the East Rand, such as Tsakane and Boksburg, and the Vaal region, including Vereeniging and Sebokeng, criminals are using hijacked vehicles during house robberies. They load stolen goods like TVs and laptops into the victim’s car, drive to a second location, offload the items into an accomplice’s vehicle, and then abandon the hijacked car. Bartmann urged motorists to remain alert and take simple precautions to reduce their risk. He advised drivers to watch their surroundings closely, especially near intersections, traffic lights, and driveways, and to avoid stopping if they suspect they are being followed. He recommended varying daily routes, keeping valuables out of sight, and leaving space to escape when arriving at home. If confronted by hijackers, he said the safest response is to comply, as resisting increases the risk of harm. Bartmann also suggested carrying a panic device such as Fidelity’s SecureMe or SecureMe Plus, which sends an instant alert to a 24-hour control room in an emergency.

This is especially true for journeys between Johannesburg and major holiday destinations like Cape Town or Durban. An average return trip by car costs approximately R4,217 to Cape Town and R2,185 to Durban. In contrast, average round-trip flight prices for the same routes are significantly higher, at R6,714 and R3,476, respectively. Despite the expected increase in diesel and petrol prices for December, South Africans can expect very simialr prices at the pumps this year compared to December 2024. This makes road travel even more attractive for budget-conscious holidaymakers. For families, the savings become even more pronounced. A car trip costs the same regardless of the number of passengers, making it far more economical for a group of four compared to flying. A family traveling by car would need to spend an extraordinary amount—around R26,000 for Cape Town or R14,000 for Durban on overnight accommodation during the journey—to match the cost of plane tickets for four.

The cost of air travel has risen notably, putting additional strain on holiday budgets. Increased operational costs for airlines, such as higher airport fees, maintenance costs, and rising demand during the festive season, have pushed ticket prices higher. Additionally, the demand for air travel spikes during the Christmas period, further driving up prices. Despite the convenience and time savings offered by air travel—especially for those who can afford the higher prices—the financial benefit of driving is hard to ignore. For solo travelers, couples, or families, the significant cost difference makes driving the preferred option. While flying takes only a few hours and eliminates the need for overnight stops, the price gap is difficult to justify for many South Africans, especially during a time when budgets are often stretched. Ultimately, whether traveling solo or with loved ones, South Africans planning their festive season getaways are likely to find driving the more economical choice for Christmas 2025. *Prices sourced from each airline’s website Departing flights were for Saturday, 20 December, while return flights were for Friday, 02 January. Air travel prices are prone to change and not all airlines offer the same packages.

In its results for the year ended 30 September 2025, the group said that it continued its long-term growth trajectory. The group saw group revenue increase by 13.1% to R26.4 billion. Buying and selling volumes of 180,576 and 179,006 units were up 7.7% and 8.4%, respectively. The number of vehicles bought and sold continues to grow, with sales volumes reaching an all-time monthly record of 16,294 units in November 2024. With monthly sales volumes exceeding 15,000 units in six of the last 12 months, the group has continued to gain market share. However, the group acknowledged that it experienced market pressure due to structural shifts within the South African automotive industry. The strength of the new vehicle market and the pricing competitiveness of Chinese brands, including GWM and Cherry, impacted consumer behaviour. “These brands have captured notable market share through attractive pricing and compelling new-vehicle offerings,” said the group. Nevertheless, it said that the buoyant new vehicle market and the growing penetration of Asian brands will be a long-term positive for the group. It said that these vehicles will enter the used-vehicle market in the future. It will also expand the group’s acquisition base and opportunity set. To maintain liquidity and ensure healthy inventory turns, the group adjusted the selling prices for vehicles to compete with asian entrants. “This proactive measure placed short-term pressure on margins during the second half of the year.” Elsewhere, WeBuyCars continued to expand and enhance its national footprint. Two new supermarkets were opened in Rustenburg in October 2024 and Vereeniging in August 2025, adding 300 and 550 parking bays, respectively. The group said that the two supermarkets have delivered pleasing results since opening. It added that upgrading existing facilities also remained a priority, with the Pietermaritzburg supermarket being relocated to a larger site. The facilities at George, Polokwane, Mbombela, the Dome, Riverhorse Valley, Gqeberha and Germiston were also expanded. As of September 2025, the national capacity increased to 12,911 parking bays. The upcoming supermarket openings in Montana (Pretoria North) and Lansdowne (Cape Town) this year will increase total capacity by over 20%. Financials The group said that it continues its long-term growth trajectory with core headline increasing 15.0% to R937.6 million. The key drivers of this growth in core headline earnings were: higher volumes, average selling prices and net insurance result. The rise in earnings was also due to lower finance costs and cost efficiencies driven by economies of scale. The group noted that it issued new shares through 2024, which has an unfavourable impact on basic, headline and core headline earnings per share. The group’s headline earnings per share did, however, increase by over 100% to 937.6 cents per share. The company’s dividend policy is to declare between 25% and 33% of its headline earnings as a dividend, subject to working capital requirements. The group upped its final dividend by 50% to 30 cents per share, with the final dividend reaching 55 cents per share. The company said that it intends to grow its footprint across South Africa responsibly. The Group believes there are opportunities to capitalise on in the short to medium term.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/843129/european-car-giant-bringing-new-luxury-cars-to-south-africa/,2026-01-17T15:55:32+00:00,,European car giant bringing new luxury cars to South Africa,,"Motoring Luke Fraser 14 Nov 2025 Motoring European car giant bringing new luxury cars to South Africa Luke Fraser · 14 Nov 2025 Swedish carmaker Volvo is bringing two new electric models to South Africa in 2026, the ES90 and the EX60. Volvo, which is owned by the Chinese carmaker Geely, will be bringing the new ES90 to the market in the mid-to-late Q1 2026. The ES90 is a sedan that is designed to offer a balance of life, with good safety, technology and versatility. It is the first Volvo car to feature 800-volt technology, enabling a longer range and faster charging than any previous electric Volvo. The car is also designed to evolve over time via continuous software updates. The vehicle was unveiled in March and aims to offer the refined elegance of a sedan with the adaptability of a fastback, as well as the spacious interior and ground clearance of an SUV. The EX60 will follow the ES90 in the mid-to-late third quarter, with the South African market one of the few outside of the EU to receive the model. The new SUV will be revealed in January 2026 and will mark Volvo’s move to make electric luxury more accessible to South Africans. Positioned between XC40 Recharge and the flagship EX90, the EX60 aims to strengthen Volvo’s growing electric SUV portfolio. The new car also promises a far larger range than any previous electric Volvo and an improved user experience. “The upcoming EX60 signals the next chapter in Volvo’s journey toward becoming a fully electric brand,” commented Grant Locke, Managing Director at Volvo Cars South Africa. “As South Africa’s EV landscape continues to expand—with more charging points, growing awareness, and an appetite for premium electrification—the EX60 will arrive at the perfect time.” “It’s designed to bring our latest technology to a broader audience while delivering the range, confidence and everyday practicality that local drivers expect.” While not being new cars, two Volvo cars will have their names changed. The C40 has already been renamed the EC40, and the XC40 Recharge will soon become the EX40. South Africa’s electric vehicle numbers rise The new Volvo ES90 While still behind most of the developed world, South Africa is starting to see increased electric vehicle numbers. The Volvo EX30 has been the best-selling electric vehicle in the nation thus far, with Volvo focusing exclusively on new-energy vehicles. Several other major manufacturers are also offering electric vehicles, including BMW and Mercedes, while new Chinese entrants are also making a splash. GWM recently launched the new electric ORA, while BYD, the largest new-energy vehicle producer, is also expanding its network. BYD has recently launched its BYD Dolphin Surf, which retails for less than R400,000, and aims to bring electric mobility to the mass market. BYD already offers the popular Dolphin hatchback, the Seal sedan, the Sealion SUV and the Shark bakkie. BYD is also investing heavily in infrastructure in South Africa, and is set to bring 300 charging stations to the country, including a new 1MW charging station. The new stations will initially be opened at the carmaker’s dealerships, then expand to the nation’s highways, and finally, to congested urban areas. BYD is also looking to expand its solar coverage across South Africa to ensure greater connectivity, even if this is far smaller than before.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/motoring/842518/new-toyota-hilux-revealed-this-is-what-it-will-look-like/,2026-01-17T15:55:36+00:00,,New Toyota Hilux revealed – this is what it will look like,,"Motoring Malcolm Libera 10 Nov 2025 Motoring New Toyota Hilux revealed – this is what it will look like Malcolm Libera · 10 Nov 2025 Toyota has officially revealed the next-generation Hilux, confirming one of the most anticipated motoring announcements of the year. The unveiling took place in Thailand, which has become a key production and launch market for Toyota’s pickup range. This new model represents the ninth generation of the Hilux and arrives a full decade after the current version made its debut. The Hilux remains the best-selling vehicle in South Africa and is manufactured locally at Toyota’s Prospecton plant in Durban. The global rollout for the new Hilux is planned for 2026 and covers a broad range of configurations. Among the biggest changes is the introduction of a battery electric vehicle (BEV) variant, which will sit alongside updated internal combustion engine (ICE) models. Engine types and availability, however, will differ depending on the country, so local buyers will need to wait for Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) to confirm the exact lineup and specifications. The new Hilux features a noticeably refreshed exterior while maintaining its familiar, boxy shape, which has become a core part of its identity. On models with traditional engines, the most prominent change is the redesigned honeycomb grille, which takes inspiration from the updated Corolla Cross. Slim LED headlights and LED daytime running lights run across the upper front section, with a black horizontal bar that replaces the traditional Toyota badge with bold “Toyota” lettering. The result is a more modern and assertive appearance that still feels connected to the Hilux heritage. One of the most notable mechanical changes is the introduction of electric power steering, a first for the Hilux. Toyota said this improves steering precision, makes low-speed manoeuvring easier, and reduces steering kickback when driving over rough terrain. The powertrain options announced so far include the well-known 2.8-litre turbo diesel engine, now paired with 48V mild hybrid support to enhance efficiency and responsiveness. The BEV version is likely to draw significant attention once performance and range figures are announced, particularly given the ongoing growth in electric vehicle interest across global markets. Updated interior The cabin sees an even more significant leap in design maturity and quality. Toyota has aligned the new Hilux with the latest Prado SUV, sharing many of the same interior architecture cues. Inside, there is a chunky three-spoke multifunction steering wheel, a push-button start, and a layered dashboard with an octagonal centre frame. This area houses the air vents, hazard function, and physical controls for the climate system, reflecting Toyota’s recent move toward retaining tactile controls instead of going entirely touchscreen-based. Below this section is a slanted panel featuring a USB Type-C port, controls for traction and hill descent management, and a rotary driving mode selector. The centre console features a gear lever that resembles the one in the new Prado, an electronic parking brake switch, and buttons for heated seats. Higher-spec models feature a floating 12.3-inch infotainment display and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, while more affordable workhorse variants are expected to make use of simpler analogue dials and trimmed-back technology solutions. Comfort and safety features include leather seats with eight-way electric adjustment, blind spot monitoring, driver attention monitoring, lane-keep assist, and automatic emergency braking. Details on South African specification levels, drivetrain selection, and pricing will be confirmed closer to its local arrival. Toyota continues to dominate new vehicle sales in South Africa, holding just under a quarter of the total market. The Hilux remains the company’s biggest contributor to this success. Toyota recently reported monthly sales of 3,553 Hilux units, which it says is a new record for the model. The continued demand speaks to its reputation for reliability, local manufacturing support, and suitability across work, leisure, and fleet environments. Toyota South Africa’s management noted that despite ongoing economic pressure in the automotive sector, the brand has continued to expand its market presence, driven largely by the Hilux. Further details will be released as Toyota progresses toward the global launch in 2026.

On average, around 60 units are sold every day across the country. It has become a familiar sight on the roads and a strong competitor in the compact SUV market, where buyers are looking for affordable vehicles with modern features. In October 2025, the Tiggo 4 range sold 1,725 units, making it the third best-selling passenger vehicle in South Africa for the month. This means it outperformed several long-established brands that have been active in the market for decades. The popularity is not limited to a single month. In the third quarter of 2025, 4,899 units were sold. Monthly sales have stayed steady, with 1,604 units in July, 1,568 in August, and 1,727 in September. The Tiggo 4 range includes 13 different versions, covering entry-level, commercial, and hybrid options. This wide variety means buyers can choose a model that fits their budget without losing essential features. The Tiggo 4 LiT, one of the most popular models in the lineup, starts at R269,900. It offers features such as touchscreen infotainment, safety technology, and a modern interior, making it appealing to buyers who want value for money without paying premium prices. Chery has also introduced a hybrid version, the Tiggo Cross CSH Hybrid. It has become one of the best-selling hybrid vehicles in South Africa, selling 122 units in August 2025. The hybrid is advertised with a fuel consumption of 5.4 litres per 100km and is priced at R439,900, making it the most affordable hybrid currently available in the country. As interest in hybrid and electric vehicles slowly grows in South Africa, this has helped strengthen Chery’s position. Other models in Chery’s lineup are also gaining traction, though at a smaller scale. The Tiggo 9 sold 41 units in September 2025, the Tiggo 8 sold 121 units, and the Tiggo 7 sold 323 units. Massive growth and major plans in South Africa These models show that Chery is expanding into larger and more expensive vehicle categories as the brand becomes more familiar to consumers. The strong sales performance of the Tiggo 4 range has also encouraged Chery to consider building vehicles locally. The company has confirmed that it is conducting feasibility studies to determine whether it should establish a manufacturing plant in South Africa. Chery also owns the Omoda and Jaecoo brands, both of which have also seen growing demand in the country. They are expected to sell more than 11,000 vehicles locally this year. This marks a significant shift from Chery’s earlier experience in South Africa. The company first entered the market in the 2000s but withdrew after struggling with negative perceptions of Chinese vehicle quality. When Chery returned in November 2021, the situation was different. The Tiggo 4 Pro, which launched at the time, was better built and supported by a more organised dealer and service network. Chery expanded quickly. It introduced the Tiggo 8 Pro and Tiggo 7 Pro in early 2022. Within a year and a half, the company had sold more than 5,300 SUVs. Sales doubled from 8,013 vehicles in 2022 to 16,110 in 2023. In October 2024, the company launched the Tiggo Cross, which helped it reach almost 20,000 sales in 2024. For comparison, the brand sold only 1,297 vehicles in 2014. The success of the Tiggo 4 shows how much consumer attitudes have changed. Many South African car buyers are now more open to Chinese brands, especially when the vehicles are affordable and offer a strong list of features.

These include the Audi A4, Jeep Renegade, Fiat Tipo, Maserati Levante, Ghibli and Quattroporte, Jaguar F-Pace, and Lexus RC. Some of these departures mark the end of an era for several long-running models as automakers shift their focus to new technologies, electric vehicles, and changing market dynamics. The Audi A4, which has been around since 1994, is being discontinued and replaced by the new A5 range. The new lineup includes four-door coupés and station wagons, marking the end of one of Audi’s most familiar sedans. The Jeep Renegade is also being cut. Sales dropped sharply in 2024, and it has already been removed from Jeep’s South African website. Jeep said it plans to introduce new models to take its place sometime in the future. Fiat has dropped the Tipo hatchback due to extremely low sales. Only nine Tipos were sold in South Africa in 2024, down from 87 in 2023. Fiat noted that it will now focus on its Panda models and new small SUVs that are expected to launch soon. Luxury brands are also slimming down. Maserati has discontinued production of three models this year—the Ghibli sedan, the Levante SUV, and the Quattroporte luxury sedan. The brand plans to replace them with new electric vehicles in the future. Jaguar is in the middle of its move to become an all-electric brand. It has already ended production of the XE, XF, and F-Type models and stopped making the E-Pace and I-Pace at the end of 2024. The F-Pace SUV continued into 2025, but it will also be discontinued this year and replaced by new electric models. The Lexus RC has also been discontinued in South Africa. The model was last updated in 2019 and was already rare on local roads. Lexus South Africa has confirmed that there are no plans for a new sports car to replace it. These model cuts come at a time when the South African car market has been performing strongly despite affordability pressures. New vehicle sales have grown for 12 consecutive months, and September 2025 saw a 24.3% year-over-year increase to 54,700 units. According to WesBank’s head of marketing and communication, Lebo Gaoaketse, this steady growth reflects improving economic conditions. “A more favourable economic outlook should continue to support increased new vehicle sales,” he said. Stable fuel prices, a stronger rand, and unchanged interest rates are giving consumers more confidence to buy cars again. Still, affordability remains a challenge. “Levels of demand are unprecedented, with September having the highest volumes of applications for finance,” said Gaoaketse. “Ten years ago, with similar sales volumes, WesBank had 28% fewer finance applications, showing how competition for credit has increased.” Passenger car sales rose 28% in September to 38,603 units, while light commercial vehicles climbed nearly 20% to 13,078 units. More buyers are opting for double-cab bakkies instead of sedans, and rental companies also boosted sales with over 8,000 new vehicles bought in September alone. The growing presence of Chinese brands has added even more competition. South Africans can now choose from more than 40 Chinese models, with prices starting at around R269,000 and going up to R1.4 million. Brands like Chery and Suzuki have seen huge growth in recent years. In 2014, they sold a combined 7,699 cars; in 2024, they sold over 76,000—an increase of nearly 900%. This surge, especially from Chery and Suzuki, has changed the market. Many South Africans facing high living costs are choosing these affordable, well-equipped cars over traditional European brands. At the same time, while some are expanding their local offerings, others, such as Audi, Jaguar, and Maserati, are discontinuing older models and preparing for the electric era. The eight cars that have been discontinued in South Africa over the course of 2025 are listed below.

This warning comes from Tax Consulting SA, which noted that their IRP6 returns and payments are accurate and submitted on time ahead of the final deadline of 28 February 2026. “As the provisional tax deadline approaches, we are seeing a growing number of taxpayers asking what they need to submit, what has changed, and how they can avoid penalties and interest,” the firm said. Provisional tax applies to individuals who earn income that is not taxed through the PAYE system. This includes income from a business, freelance or consulting work, rental income, or certain investments. Because this income does not go through an employer’s payroll, SARS requires taxpayers to pay their income tax in advance through provisional tax rather than settling the full amount at the end of the tax year. “If you earn income other than a salary, you need to understand your provisional tax obligations and make sure your IRP6 submissions and payments are correct and on time,” the firm said. According to SARS data, more than 543,000 provisional taxpayers submitted returns in 2024, and that number continues to grow. Provisional tax is paid in two stages. The first IRP6 return and payment were due on 30 August 2025 and generally represented half of the estimated total tax liability for the year. The second and final provisional tax return is due on 28 February 2026 and covers the balance of the estimated tax for the year, taking into account the first payment. “This February deadline is often confused with the January filing deadline,” Tax Consulting SA warned. “The 19 January 2026 date applies to the submission of the final annual income tax return, not the payment of provisional tax. Missing the February deadline can have serious consequences.” Compliance levels remain a concern Not every taxpayer with extra income is automatically a provisional taxpayer. Natural persons who do not carry on a business are exempt if their total taxable income falls below the annual tax threshold. For the 2025 tax year, the thresholds are: R95,750 for individuals under 65, R148,217 for those aged 65 to 75, and R165,689 for those aged 75 and older. “Once your income exceeds these thresholds, provisional tax becomes a requirement, not a choice,” Tax Consulting SA said. SARS has repeatedly emphasised that provisional tax is not a separate tax. It is simply a method of paying income tax in advance. “Provisional tax exists to prevent taxpayers from sitting with a large tax bill at assessment,” Tax Consulting SA explained. “It helps manage cash flow, but it also places responsibility on the taxpayer to submit realistic income estimates.” If a provisional taxpayer fails to submit a final provisional tax return within four months after the end of the tax year, SARS may treat the estimate as nil or adjust it if it believes the figures are unrealistic. “Where no estimate is submitted at all, SARS is entitled to determine taxable income based on available information,” Tax Consulting SA added. “Continued non-compliance can escalate to collection steps such as final demands, third-party appointments, or legal action.” Missing provisional tax deadlines or submitting incorrect IRP6 returns exposes taxpayers to administrative penalties and interest, which accrue from the due date until the amount is fully paid. “In some cases, the interest charged can exceed the original provisional tax liability,” Tax Consulting SA warned. SARS has acknowledged that the number of provisional taxpayers filing returns is increasing, but said compliance levels remain a concern.

Glencore recently announced that it was in merger talks with Rio Tinto in a deal that would create the world’s largest mining company, worth around R3 trillion. The companies are discussing a potential combination of some or all of their businesses, which includes an all-share takeover. However, they stressed that there is no certainty that the terms of any transaction or offer will be agreed upon. Nevertheless, the move has seen Glencore’s share price rise by around 13% since the start of 2026, with its market cap now standing at R1.4 trillion. Glasenberg, who served as CEO from 2002 to 2021, holds the most significant individual stake in the company and has seen his net worth increase following the announcement that talks were underway. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Glasenberg has seen his net worth rise by $1.07 billion (around R17.4 billion) year-to-date. This takes his total fortune to $12.1 billion (around R200 billion). While he grew up in South Africa, Glasenberg now lives in Switzerland. Despite seeing his net worth rise, Glencore’s current CEO, Gary Nagle, known as mini Ivan, will primarily handle the talks with Rio Tinto. The merger between Rio Tinto and Glencore has been described as the most obvious deal by Nagle, while Glasenberg had attempted to finalise the contract for two decades. It is reported that Rio Tinto has confirmed that it is being left behind as the copper M&A frenzy sweeps the sector. Anglo American and Canada’s Teck Resources are set to merge, creating a copper giant. Boy from Illovo Born in Johannesburg in 1957 to an immigrant Jewish family, he grew up in Illovo and attended Hyde Park High School. While not a gifted student, he was a passionate racewalker who won the South African national junior championships and nearly qualified for the 1984 Olympics, but was unable to attend due to South Africa’s exclusion. After studying at the University of Witwatersrand, he became a Chartered Accountant. He joined Marc Rich & Co. as a marketer in its South African business. He quickly moved through the marketing division into Marc Rich & Co.’s coal department for South Africa and Australia. After Marc Rich & Co. was sold to Glencore International, Glasenberg’s first few years as CEO were incredibly challenging, having to deal with issues from Glencore and Marc Rich’s controversial past. The CIA accused the company of illegal dealings with ‘rogue states’ such as Apartheid South Africa, the Soviet Union, Iran, and Iraq. Glasenberg focused on reinventing the company and wanted the company to own and operate its own mines, allowing it to control the entire value chain. This set it apart from its commodity-trading peers. He drove the merger of Glencore and Xstrata to form a mining and trading powerhouse, which is currently the most significant mining merger in history. Glencore bought Xstrata for £39.1 billion ($62 billion at the time), creating an entity with revenue of $209 billion in 2012. This would only be outdone by a merger between Glencore and Rio Tinto. However, during his tenure, the company continued to face widespread allegations of corruption , paying at least $1.7 billion in settlements related to bribes and corruption following several investigations. In South Africa, Glencore continues to operate through its coal mines and its ownership of Astron Energy, which operates an oil refinery in Cape Town.

South Africa was added to the EU list in August 2023 as an automatic consequence of its greylisting earlier that year. The country was added to the grey list for failures in its response to illicit financial flows, including money laundering and the funding of terrorism. The EU listing required third-country jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their systems for detecting illicit financial flows to be identified, thereby protecting the functioning of the EU’s internal market. EU law requires that its financial institutions apply a higher level of scrutiny to transactions involving parties in countries seen as high-risk. National Treasury stated that this results in more rigorous and intrusive checks, increased documentation requirements, continuous monitoring, and senior management approval for transactions. These requirements added friction to financial transactions and flows, which impacted trade, payments and investment. Following a massive undertaking by the National Treasury, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), and others, South Africa met 22 action items and was removed from the grey list in 2025. With South Africa now off the grey list, it has also been taken off the European Union’s list of “High- Risk Third Country Jurisdictions. South Africa’s removal from the EU’s list will take effect officially on 29 January 2026. Not done yet Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana (far left), joined by senior treasury officials National Treasury stressed that the removal from the EU’s list does not compel EU financial institutions to rescind their risk assessment policies towards South Africa. It rather allows willing EU financial institutions to adjust their risk assessment policies as they see fit. National Treasury also noted that the removal from the FATF and EU lists does not mean that all of South Africa’s challenges in implementing its Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism system have been resolved. It recognised that much work will need to be done to strengthen deficiencies in the prevention, identification, investigation and prosecution of money laundering and terrorism financing. South Africa will enter a new round of evaluation by FATF in the coming months, with the final report scheduled to be presented to the FATF plenary in October 2027. “Preparation has begun in earnest, incorporating the lessons learnt and experience gained during the process to exit FATF greylisting,” said the National Treasury. While South Africa is not yet out of the woods, being removed from the grey list adds to the many positives going into 2026. Economic growth is expected to reach around 1.5% in 2026, supported by lower inflation and interest rates. This represents a significant improvement from the 0.7% recorded in 2023 and 2024, with 2025 expected to reach around 1%. Looking at the specifics, inflation is expected to remain broadly around the SARB’s new target of 3% for the financial year, supported by a stronger rand, lower fuel prices, and good rains. The lower inflation figures should enable the SARB to continue its interest rate-cutting cycle, with two 50-basis-point cuts widely expected for 2026, taking the repo rate to 6.25%.

SA Canegrowers has warned that unless the government urgently changes course, the industry could face serious long-term damage, with major consequences for jobs, rural communities and food security. The sugar sector supports more than one million livelihoods, directly and indirectly, mainly in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. This includes about 27,000 small-scale growers and 1,100 large-scale farmers who form the backbone of the industry. According to SA Canegrowers, these growers have been under intense strain for more than a year due to rising input costs, unstable global prices and weak local demand. The organisation said that the continued application of the sugar tax is making a bad situation worse. Additionally, South Africa has seen a sharp increase in imported sugar. SA Canegrowers’ analysis of SARS data shows that 153,344 tonnes of sugar were imported between January and September 2025. This is far higher than the 20,924 tonnes imported over the same period in 2020, and well above the previous high of 55,213 tonnes recorded in 2024. The organisation said this surge is not because South Africa lacks sugar, but because global markets are distorted. SA Canegrowers chairman Higgins Mdluli noted that much of the imported sugar entering the country is heavily subsidised in exporting nations. “Imported sugar is often heavily subsidised in exporting countries, but the only people who benefit are the agents who import the sugar into South Africa,” he said. “These people are often able to reap high short-term profits by selling the sugar at local market prices.” He argued that this puts local producers at an unfair disadvantage. Globally, the sugar market is oversupplied, with major producers able to dump excess sugar at very low prices. Subsidies, favourable exchange rates, and weak growth in demand all contribute to this problem. Calls to scrap the sugar tax SA Canegrowers chairman Higgins Mdluli Mdluli stated that in such an environment, South Africa requires robust protection for its local market. Without them, local growers are forced to compete with cheap imports while also dealing with policies that reduce demand for their product. “In this environment, protecting South Africa’s domestic market is critical. Without effective safeguards, local growers are forced to compete against dumped imports while facing policies that suppress local demand,” Mdluli said. He warned that allowing imported sugar to replace locally produced sugar undermines food security, damages rural economies and threatens the future of a strategic agricultural sector. South Africa’s sugarcane growers already produce enough sugar to meet local demand. As a result, imported sugar does not fill a gap in supply, but instead replaces local sugar on supermarket shelves and in supply contracts with food and beverage manufacturers. SA Canegrowers said this reduces the volumes processed by local mills and weakens the entire value chain, from farms to factories. The organisation is also strongly critical of the sugar tax, which it stressed continues to punish local producers and manufacturers without delivering clear health benefits. While SA Canegrowers noted it supports efforts to improve public health, it argued that there is no solid evidence that the tax has led to meaningful health improvements. However, it said the economic harm is clear. When the sugar tax was introduced in 2018, the industry lost more than 16,000 jobs in its first year. “The sugar tax is an unproven policy experiment with very real consequences for rural jobs and investment,” Mdluli said. He added that future decisions should be based on proper health data and an accurate picture of how much sugar South Africans consume, while also taking into account the impact on jobs, the economy and local food production. SA Canegrowers is calling on the government to act quickly to ensure fair trading conditions. This includes properly enforcing existing import protection measures and engaging more closely with the industry on policies that affect its future. The organisation said that a meaningful first step would be for Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana to scrap the sugar tax. As SA Canegrowers has stressed, saving the sugar industry is not only about farmers, but about protecting jobs, supporting rural communities and maintaining South Africa’s ability to produce its own food.

Best Before is a unique retailer which sells short and past-dated quality food and personal care products at highly discounted prices. The retailer does not sell anything past its use-by date. “All our lines come from trusted and reputable suppliers with stringent quality control,” it explains. Best Before was founded in 2017 by Mark Gordon and Alain Soriano to disrupt the South African food retail sector with affordable products. They realised that there was a strong market in South Africa for affordable everyday products, as many households were struggling. Gordon and Soriano launched a pilot store in Wendywood, Sandton, and it was an instant hit. The demand data showed that the strategy was effective. After the success of the first Best Before store, they expanded their partnership with many of South Africa’s largest food suppliers to deliver quality food at great prices. The retailer negotiates favourable pricing with food producers and passes these savings to its customers. It is a winning formula. The founders began rolling out more Best Before stores across Gauteng to serve clients in other areas. They expanded their footprint in Johannesburg with new stores in Woodmead, Edenvale, Fourways, Northcliff, Krugersdorp, and Boksburg. In October 2024, Best Before launched its first store in Pretoria. The new outlet is based in the Atterbury Lifestyle Centre in the east of Pretoria. On 29 August 2025, Best Before further grew its footprint with its latest store opening in the Centurion Lifestyle Centre in Pretoria. The Best Before management stated that the new Pretoria store was one of the largest in the group’s portfolio and was an instant hit. Gordon told BusinessTech that thousands of people visited the new Best Before store within the first few days. He said the record number of shoppers shows the importance of Best Before’s offering, which makes everyday products more affordable to South Africans. Best Before nationwide online shopping Towards the end of 2025, Best Before started offering nationwide courier delivery through its online shopping portal. Previously, its online shopping service was only available to Gauteng residents. However, it had always planned to roll this out to other provinces. The new nationwide courier delivery means that people across South Africa can order Best Before deals with lower prices than other retailers. The retailer also has the option to collect their order from a Best Before store near them by selecting ‘collect from store’ during checkout. “Collections and in-store transfers take up to 5 working days to prepare. Once your order is ready, you’ll be notified to pick up your goods hassle-free,” it said. The nationwide delivery followed Best Before introducing a selection of unique imported products, marking a first for the South African market. These new offerings feature prominent brands such as Mountain Dew, Oshee, Côte d’Or, Toblerone, Hershey’s, Bokomo, Caffelux, Willards, Koo, Robertsons, and Labello. These products are typically lower-priced than those of prominent retailers such as Pick n Pay, Checkers, Spar, and Woolworths. A recent comparison of Best Before’s weekly deals showed that these products cost 46% less than at a traditional supermarket.

In reality, January is when standards either reset or quietly drop. Every year, organisations publish goals, strategies, and plans. Click here to learn more about Alpha . Very few pause to ask a more important question, what standard are we actually operating at, day to day, when pressure is on. Results do not drift randomly. They follow standards. Over time, I have learned that leadership is not defined by how ambitious your strategy sounds, but by how consistently you defend your standard when decisions become uncomfortable. And they always do. The quiet erosion of standards Most organisations do not fail because of bad decisions. They fail because of small compromises that feel reasonable in the moment. A meeting is postponed instead of resolved. A process is bypassed just this once. A role is filled quickly rather than correctly. A customer issue is smoothed over to avoid friction, not addressed properly. None of these look serious on their own. Together, they reset the organisation’s operating level without anyone ever making a conscious decision to do so. Standards do not collapse loudly. They erode quietly. By the time performance slips, trust weakens, or culture frays, the damage has already been done long before it becomes visible. Leadership is not what you say, it is what you allow One lesson stands above the rest, leaders do not set standards by what they say, but by what they tolerate. You can speak about excellence all you want. However, if poor execution is excused, if accountability is softened, or if clarity is traded for comfort, the real standard becomes obvious very quickly. This is where leadership discipline often breaks down. The intention is good. The discipline is inconsistent. Resetting the standard means being willing to hold the line when it creates tension, especially when it creates tension. Systems matter more than slogans Another common mistake is believing that standards live in values statements or speeches. They do not. Standards live in systems. They live in how decisions are made, how work is reviewed, how issues are escalated, and how exceptions are handled. If the system allows shortcuts, shortcuts will eventually become normal behaviour. At Alpha, we stopped talking about working harder or doing better years ago. Instead, we focused on building systems that make it difficult to operate below the required standard. That shift did not change slogans. It changed daily decisions. When standards are built into systems, leadership becomes less reactive. The organisation begins to regulate itself. Visibility follows discipline There is a common belief that reputation is built through communication. In reality, reputation is built through repeatable behaviour. What an organisation becomes known for externally is a direct reflection of how disciplined it is internally. No amount of messaging can compensate for inconsistency on the ground. This is why leadership visibility should never be treated as marketing. Visibility is an outcome of operational discipline, not a substitute for it. When standards are clear and systems are tight, visibility becomes a by product. When they are not, visibility turns into noise. 2026 is not about doing more As we move into 2026, many leaders feel pressure to accelerate. New technology, economic uncertainty, and constant comparison create urgency. The instinct is to do more. The real opportunity lies in the opposite direction. This is the year to do fewer things properly, and to defend the standard without compromise. Resetting the standard means saying no more often, being clearer not louder, choosing consistency over speed, and protecting quality when deadlines tighten. These choices are rarely popular. But they are the choices that separate leadership from management. The real test of leadership Leadership is easy when growth is strong and conditions are stable. It is tested when trade-offs appear. Do you compromise the standard to maintain momentum, or do you slow down to protect it. Every organisation answers that question eventually. The ones that endure answer it correctly, even when it costs them in the short term. As this year begins, the challenge is simple, do not reset your goals before you reset your standard. Because once the standard is clear, defended, and enforced through systems, results tend to follow. And when they do, they last. Click here to learn more about Alpha .

The expansion represents a strategic commitment to financial inclusion, youth employment, and the digitisation of South Africa’s informal economy. Discover more about Altron FinTech’s Kasi Businesses . Launched as a pilot in Soweto, the Kasi Sales Squad addresses a critical gap: township businesses power daily life for millions of South Africans, yet many remain locked out of secure, modern payment systems. The initiative deploys locally recruited youth consultants who deliver tailored fintech solutions, including DebiCheck recurring payments, offline-capable POS devices, and digital disbursement tools, directly into communities that have historically been underserved by traditional financial infrastructure. “The idea started with a simple insight: township entrepreneurs were already running powerful businesses, but lacked access to secure, enterprise-grade payment tools,” Juice Ndlovu, Supervisor: Sales “Our Soweto pilot proved that when you bring solutions to the community, in their language and on their terms, adoption grows quickly. We’ve now seen strong demand from Ekurhuleni and the Johannesburg CBD, where traders want safer payments, formalised collections, and digital disbursements.” Addressing real payment challenges in township commerce Township businesses face distinct operational challenges that limit growth and profitability: cash-handling risks, customers missing instalments, manual bookkeeping, load-shedding interruptions, out-of-service ATMs, and difficulty paying staff safely. Many people no longer carry cash, and the inconvenience of broken ATMs due to vandalism and technical issues has resulted in businesses losing out on sales. The Kasi Sales Squad responds with practical, trusted tools matched to these pain points: DebiCheck enables recurring debit orders with bank consent and digital proof, reducing disputes and ensuring predictable cash flow for monthly repayments, lay-bys, tabs, school fees, rentals, and loans Offline-ready POS devices solve load-shedding payment gaps by queuing transactions, protecting daily revenue during power outages NuCash and NuCard remove cash-handling risks through mobile payouts and prepaid chip-and-PIN cards, enabling traders to pay staff and suppliers securely with full digital audit trails KwikKadima turns any counter into a compliant loan desk, allowing micro-lenders to approve in minutes, disburse fast, and collect automatically “Cards are great for once-off sales, but DebiCheck handles the recurring side,” explained Ndlovu “It’s the only solution where the customer approves via their own bank, reducing reversals and boosting predictable cash flow. This is our unique value proposition in the kasi market – DebiCheck can improve how supermarkets and spaza shops structure grocery packages on credit, with repayments managed through digitally approved mandates.” Transformation through youth employment and skills development The Kasi Sales Squad creates tangible transformation impact by recruiting young consultants from the communities they serve. Each squad member receives comprehensive training in digital payments, sales, compliance, and product knowledge, creating pathways into fintech careers while bringing authentic community insight to solution development. “Our team of eight young consultants recruited from the areas we engage are able to understand their communities and local payment challenges,” said Ndlovu “With this feedback, we develop real solutions for real problems and, in doing so, modernise kasi commerce. Being at ground zero gives us a personal touch – that’s what builds trust and allows us to have in depth conversations with businesses around exact solutions for their unique challenges.” The on-the-ground service model is critical in communities that rely on relationships and trust. Traders want to deal with people, not just call centres. By being visible, speaking the language, and solving their day-to-day challenges rather than selling products, the Squad has become part of the township business ecosystem. Measurable impact and future expansion After three months on the platform, traders report faster cash flow, fewer missed payments, better record-keeping, and increased confidence in offering credit safely. Altron FinTech tracks impact through jobs created, SMEs digitized, recurring payments secured via DebiCheck, reduction in cash risk, and uplift in trader revenue. “Having a presence in the biggest townships in the country gives us a tremendous opportunity to not just sell, but to bring great financial systems and solutions into spaces that have not always received the due level of attention previously,” said Juice Ndlovu, Supervisor: Sales “In addition, having proper systems in place enhances important elements such as safety and convenience for both business owners and their customers.” The expansion into Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg CBD targets territories with enormous trading density and strong appetite for digital payments. Both markets demonstrate higher need for secure collections, safer disbursements, and tools that work during load-shedding. Traders want to formalize operations without losing their kasi identity. Further expansion is on the roadmap, with new territories already identified. “Over the next three to five years, we aim to build the country’s most trusted township fintech ecosystem, empowering thousands of SMEs with safe, modern, affordable payment tools,” said Juice “We’re going to do this with local sales squads built within these communities, and we want to be represented in all kasi markets throughout Mzansi.” Discover more about Altron FinTech’s Kasi Businesses .

But while skills development is often treated as a compliance exercise, forward-thinking businesses are using their annual training spend to solve far more practical problems: skills shortages, digital capability gaps, and succession risk. Contact Emmarentia Booysen for more information. According to CTU Training Solutions , organisations that approach skills development strategically at the start of the year gain a measurable advantage, not just in compliance, but in operational resilience. Emmarentia Booysen , Skills Development Manager at CTU, says the biggest mistake employers make is assuming that training must be generic to be compliant. Emmarentia Booysen, Skills Development Manager at CTU “One of the most persistent myths is that skills development has to be disconnected from real business needs,” Booysen explains. “In reality, the strongest skills strategies are the ones that solve immediate operational challenges while still meeting learnership and WSP requirements.” The Skills Gap Is No Longer Abstract South African businesses are no longer talking about skills shortages in theory, they are experiencing them daily. Cybersecurity incidents, cloud migration challenges, data capability gaps, and inexperienced junior managers are placing pressure on teams that are already stretched. “What we’re seeing is that companies don’t necessarily need more training, they need the right training,” says Booysen. “That’s where occupational certificates and structured learnerships become extremely powerful.” Unlike short courses, occupational qualifications are designed around real job roles , making them ideal for organisations looking to build capability internally rather than recruit scarce skills externally. Occupational Certificates That Align With Real Roles CTU has seen growing demand for occupational qualifications that directly support priority business functions, particularly in technology and management. Among the most popular learnership-aligned programmes are: Occupational Certificate: Cybersecurity Analyst (NQF 5) Ideal for organisations needing internal security monitoring, risk awareness, and incident response capability. Occupational Certificate: Cloud Administrator (NQF 4) Supports businesses transitioning to cloud-based environments or managing Microsoft and hybrid infrastructure. Occupational Certificate: Artificial Intelligence Software Developer (NQF 5) Designed for organisations exploring automation, AI-driven solutions, and data-led innovation. Higher Certificate in Management (NQF 5) Frequently used to upskill junior managers, supervisors, and team leads — a critical but often overlooked risk area. These qualifications are practical, structured, and highly applicable. They allow businesses to invest in people who already understand their organisation, rather than constantly trying to hire from a shrinking talent pool. “When training is aligned to an actual role, the return on investment becomes far easier to see,” says Booysen. This approach also simplifies WSP reporting and creates clearer links between training activity and business performance. Watch this space: Annual WSP Online Event CTU’s Corporate Division will be hosting an online awareness session in March focused on Workplace Skills Planning, annual training spend, and practical skills development strategy. The session will unpack how organisations can make smarter use of their training budgets, navigate WSP requirements with confidence, and align skills development with real workforce needs. Further details will be shared closer to the event. Contact Emmarentia Booysen for more information.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/industry-news/847829/transforming-reconciliation-operations-into-automated-momentum/,2026-01-17T15:56:25+00:00,,Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum,,"Presented by Transaction Junction Partner 14 Jan 2026 Presented by Transaction Junction Transforming reconciliation operations into automated momentum Partner · 14 Jan 2026 Southern African fintech, Transaction Junction (TJ), has recently launched its new automated reconciliation platform, TJ Recon PRO. This reconciliation platform is designed to replace manual processes with a streamlined model, ensuring that as a business scales, its financial integrity remains absolute. In an evolving retail landscape, the gap between making a sale and seeing that cash in the bank is where risk lives. Reconciliation is the essential process that aims to bridge that gap. It is the fundamental process of ensuring that every sale matches what is deposited into your bank account. Watch the video below for more information. The challenge: why manual processes stagnate growth Many businesses still rely on high-cost manual processes – matching till slips or banking records to fragmented spreadsheets. This complexity makes operations highly prone to human error, triggering a “domino effect” of issues that can quietly steal a significant percentage of hard-earned profits. According to Transaction Junction, in today’s multi-channel environment, the limitations of manual recon systems are severe and fall into two critical categories: High operational overheads Time drain – Finance teams spend days performing tedious “recon detective work” – chasing mismatches and manually adjusting entries – leaving less time for strategic, high-value progress. Additionally, the hours spent manually matching data mean your team is always a step behind, unable to provide the prompt intelligence to scale. Labour costs – Manual reconciliation requires dedicated staff for repetitive, low-value data matching, creating high labour overheads. Human error rooted in manual complexity The sheer complexity and manual nature of traditional reconciliation make it highly prone to human error, triggering a “domino effect” of issues: Revenue leakage – When unmatched transactions are handled days or weeks later, missing funds often become irrecoverable, costing retailers up to 5% in revenue. Undetected fraud – Delayed matching means fraudulent activity is only spotted long after the transaction occurs, making timely intervention impossible. Compliance risks – Stagnant data and a lack of a digital audit trail compromise your regulatory standing and financial integrity. TJ Recon PRO: Presenting the needle in the haystack This manual “detective work” is not just slow; it’s an expensive barrier to growth. According to Transaction Junction, TJ Recon PRO changes the narrative by providing sophisticated infrastructure that interrogates all transaction records across the Client (POS), Switch (TJ), and Provider (Banks and other payment providers) simultaneously. Instead of searching for the needle in the haystack, Transaction Junction says your team is presented with the “needle” immediately. Discrepancies are isolated and flagged clearly as “Unmatched,” “Provider Only,” “Store Only,” or “Switch Only,” allowing for rapid resolution and absolute precision. Once a transaction is labelled as “Reconciled,” no further action is needed. Comprehensive coverage for your entire ecosystem TJ Recon Pro is built for the modern ecosystem, eliminating the need for fragmented tools. It provides comprehensive coverage across your entire financial landscape: Channels and scale – It covers multiple channels (in-store, online, hybrid) and scales from single stores to branches, franchises, and large enterprises. Financial institutions – The platform supports multiple banks, including Absa, Capitec, FNB, Nedbank, Standard Bank, Bank Windhoek, Absa Africa, FNB Africa, Nedbank Africa, and Stanbic. POS integrations: Integrated into 90+ point of sale (POS) providers, and doing more all the time. Payment ecosystem: It reconciles an array of payment methods from multiple providers: Various card schemes Loyalty Buy Now Pay Later Digital wallets Instant EFT QR payment apps Credit providers VAS providers (airtime, data, electricity, lotto, and more). Certainty delivered through real-time rolling reconciliation The platform provides Real-Time Rolling Reconciliation, matching transactions the moment data is available rather than waiting for bulk-batch processing. This allows system errors to be flagged within minutes, ensuring maximum recovery rates and total financial integrity. According to Transaction Junction, TJ Recon PRO moves beyond technical specifications to focus on the feeling of confidence that comes from reliable, scalable, and human-centric financial technology. By returning 95% of manual recon time to the business, TJ Recon PRO empowers finance teams to shift their focus to more strategic initiatives that drive business growth. Explore the full capabilities of our frictionless reconciliation foundation here.

Redhill is the only school in South Africa that offers students the choice of graduating with either an IEB or an IB qualification. Despite offering two possible paths, the school topped the IEB’s list in terms of distinctions per student, marking the highest number in the school’s history. An analysis from BusinessTech showed that the school was the best-performing private school in the country in 2025 when considering some of the country’s most prominent schools with over 50 matrics. The school said that the average reflects the academic strength of the 2025 cohort. Highlights from the IEB include: 98% of students achieving at least one A 17% achieved a *90%+ average* 55% achieved an A average 93% achieved a B average or higher 22% achieved a full house (seven or more distinctions) 43% of all distinctions were awarded at *90% or above* Many of Redhill’s top academic students are also following the IB pathway and are therefore not included in the IEB distinction tally. “This means these results represent only part of the academic strength of this cohort. That makes the achievement all the more impressive,” said Executive Head Joseph Gerassi. The school’s average IB score was 33.31 out of 45, which stands at 4.01 points above the world average. “ Our focus is on developing confident, resilient young people who are engaged in school life, supported by their community and equipped to manage challenge – not simply to perform under pressure,” added Gerassi. A school formed 120 years ago The school’s roots date back to 1907, when St Winifred’s School for Girls, which occupied a small double-storey building in Yeoville, Johannesburg. The school was relocated to Parkview in 1924, where a new modern building was erected, which quickly transformed the school into a highly regarded educational establishment for girls. The school underwent a massive transformation when Catherine Hill became the Headmistress, with a bold vision to completely transform and revitalise the school’s image, both physically and in its name. It was renamed “Redhill School”, named for the Headmistress and the vibrant colour of the new uniforms. Amid financial struggles, the school sought more affordable premises and ultimately settled in the rondavels in Morningside. In an effort to raise funds, the school was registered as a company on 6 April 1946. At the time, many parents agreed to serve on the Board of Directors. Amid further financial challenges, the school’s governing body approached Dr Isaac Kriel, the majority shareholder of the Damelin Group, to acquire the school. Redhill School officially came under the guidance of the Damelin Group in 1968, in a deal valued at R300,000 (approximately R31 million today). Redhill then underwent significant changes, growing from a girls’ school of 150 pupils to 630 pupils, including boys, within 10 years. After Kriel left the school, the school came under the care of a trust, which was registered in July 1979, and a Board of Trustees. Throughout the 1980s, the number of black students admitted to Redhill increased, and a scholarship scheme was established to provide scholarships for them. This was despite laws restricting black children from attending what the government saw as a ‘whites only’ school. “After a challenging century, Redhill has weathered many storms and grown to become one of the leading educational institutions in South Africa,” the school said on its website. “It has overcome times of economic and financial hardship to grow from modest beginnings to a financially stable, innovative and progressive school.” Redhill School Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 1h AGOA hope for South Africa Lifestyle · 2h 25-year-old foreigners are retiring in South Africa Motoring · 4h Petrol price reality check for South African motorists Government · 5h US sends another tariff threat to South Africa Property · 7h New shopping mall opening in South Africa in two months Government · 8h Important deadline for employers in South Africa coming this week Industry News Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa Partner content Codehesion can build a world-class smartphone app for your business in 2026 Partner content Enhancing post-retirement income with discretionary solutions More News 5 Things · 9h Billionaire Motsepe’s companies seek protection from US firm, and problems for Temu orders in South Africa Media · 9h Journalism Graduates – Apply Today Lifestyle · 10h 2025 matric results: Top-performing private schools in South Africa Government · 22h 2025 matric pass rate hits record 88% in South Africa Business Opinion · 1d Magnus Heystek’s advice to anyone choosing to stay in South Africa Finance · 1d The tide is turning for South Africa Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/847807/agoa-hope-for-south-africa/,2026-01-17T15:56:32+00:00,,AGOA hope for South Africa,,"Government Luke Fraser 13 Jan 2026 Government AGOA hope for South Africa Luke Fraser · 13 Jan 2026 The US House of Representatives has supported a renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), but South Africans should not get too optimistic. AGOA provides African markets with duty-free access to the US market and has been utilised by South African automobile and product exporters. Approximately 22% of South African exports to the US benefit from AGOA, resulting in billions of dollars in trade. Estimates suggest that half a million South African jobs are dependent on AGOA. Fears that a renewal would not take place have remained high, as the current US administration has pushed an “America First” strategy and implemented high tariffs. However, the US House of Representatives broadly supported the bill, with bipartisan support from Republican and Democratic voters, passing by a vote of 340 to 54. This would extend the AGOA renewal until 31 December 2028. The US sees the move as essential to limiting China and Russia’s growing influence on the continent. The bill still needs to be voted on in the US Senate and signed by US President Donald Trump amid a tense relationship between South Africa and the world’s largest economy. While groups in South Africa have welcomed the move, concerns remain over a lack of clarity regarding South Africa’s position. “When trade agreements hang in the balance, the South African Rand often bears the brunt, wiping out the thin margins of exporters far faster than any headline tariff could,” said James Booth from Verto. Trade union Solidarity stated that South Africa is likely to be excluded from AGOA, as the list of countries benefiting from AGOA is determined by the White House. Amid the disputes between South Africa and the US, the prospects of a Trump administration including South Africa are slim. “For the US to punish these ordinary citizens serves no purpose,” said Jaco Kleynhans, Head of Public Liaison at Solidarity. “In fact, AGOA enables the US to set specific conditions that would compel the South African government to act, for once, in the best interests of the country.” A strained relationship South Africa’s relationship with the US administration has been incredibly strained since Trump’s return. On the economic side, Trump imposed a 30% tariff on goods from South Africa in 2025, with questions over how the administration arrived at the figure. Trump has now threatened that any country that works with Iran will be hit with sanctions. This comes on the eve of Iran’s participation in a naval exercise with South Africa, China, and Russia in Cape Town. On the political front, the president has also accused South Africa of conducting a white genocide, even if statistics continue to show that this is not the case. In response to the “genocide,” the administration allowed white South Africans to come to the USA as refugees. The US has also limited diplomatic talks with South Africa and did not send senior government officials to the official G20 leaders summit in Johannesburg in November 2025. While the US has appointed Leo Brent Bozell III as ambassador to South Africa, the opposite has yet to occur. Former South African ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, was deemed persona non g rata after he had accused Trump of white extremism.

According to immigration experts at Xpatweb, applications for work visas and permanent residency will soon be strongly linked to how foreign nationals contribute to the country’s economy. According to the Draft Revised White Paper on Citizenship, Immigration, and Refugee Protection, Home Affairs intends to introduce higher age thresholds for granting a retirement visa for long-term stays. Notably, the White Paper looks to end the perceived abuse of the Retired Person Visa category. Unlike other countries, South Africa has not set an age limit to qualify for the retirement visa, which results in visas being issued to applicants as young as 25. The department added that about 65% of applicants are under the age of 55, with evidence suggesting that some then take up employment. Home Affairs said that this constitutes abuse of the visa, which is being used to circumvent work visa requirements. The White Paper proposes introducing a minimum age threshold, increasing financial requirements in line with the cost of living in South Africa, and granting waivers only in exceptional cases. Moreover, the current Financially Independent Permanent Residence permit will be replaced with an investment-based Financial Independence residence visa. This will require a portion of the applicant’s net worth to be invested in South Africa for a specified period, and forms part of the broader effort to have immigrants contribute to the local economy. Massive changes The department has noted that the nation’s current visa regime fails to attract the migrants needed to drive economic growth. Relative visas account for 28% of applications, while critical skills and business make up just 5% and 1%, respectively. The department stated that far too few applications are being submitted through the categories most closely linked to economic growth. To address the gaps, the draft paper suggests rationalising existing visas and introducing several new categories. One reform is the Skilled Worker Visa, which combines existing Critical Skills and General Work visas with a single, employment-based pathway spanning different skill levels. Employers would need to sponsor foreign workers for the duration of their contracts, with renewals linked to continued employment. Moreover, existing business visas are limited to established businesses and do not cater to individuals who wish to reside in South Africa to establish a new business venture with potential economic benefits. That said, a proposed standalone Start-Up Visa will attract innovators and entrepreneurs with ideas to boost the economy, mirroring “innovation visa” models used elsewhere in the world. The existing Business Visa will also be converted into an Investment Visa, with minimum capital thresholds and employment quotas set by sector and updated regularly. Other categories include the Sectoral Work visas to replace the current corporate visas, as well as a new Sports and Arts Visa aimed at performers, athletes, coaches, and industry professionals. When it comes to citizenship, the department stated that decisions should not be made, but instead be reserved for individuals who demonstrate a commitment to South Africa’s economic and social development. “A points-based system would assess permanent residence and citizenship applications using objective eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, accountability, and alignment with national priorities,” said Xpatweb. “Applicants with critical skills, those who create jobs, invest in businesses, or contribute to economic growth would score higher, while additional weight would be given to meaningful community service, research, or innovation that benefits the country.” This will mark a shift away from permanent residence eligibility based primarily on length of stay toward a merit-based system. This is similar to Canada, Australia and the UK. “This White Paper sends a clear signal that South Africa is repositioning its immigration system around merit, skills needed, and economic contribution,” said Marisa Jacobs, Managing Director at Xpatweb. “Taken together, the proposals point to a recalibration of the immigration policy.” Public comments on the draft paper must be submitted by January 31, 2026.

US President Donald Trump announced on Monday (12 January) that any country doing business with Iran will be subject to a 25% tariff rate on all transactions with the United States. “Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “This Order is final and conclusive,” he said. While South Africa’s direct trade with Iran is relatively small, the broader implications of this move are severe. South Africa’s trade relationship with Iran is limited, largely consisting of modest agricultural exports. South Africa and Iran trade a range of goods. South Africa exports items such as medical instruments, rubber tyres, and coal. In return, it imports tropical fruits, carpets, and oil and petroleum products from Iran. Additionally, recent trends indicate an increase in South African imports from Iran, while exports to Iran are declining. However, South Africa’s military ties with Iran were recently highlighted in Simon’s Town, Cape Town. Iran sent two vessels to the Simon’s Town naval base over the last week to participate in military drills with South Africa, China and Russia. While News24 reported that Iran is not taking part in any war games and will instead hold observer status after diplomatic negotiations, the move highlights the relationship between the two nations. The decision to ask Iran not to take part is reportedly linked to South Africa’s trade goals with the USA. By comparison, the country exports billions of rand worth of vehicles, automotive components, and minerals to the United States each year. This imbalance makes the potential impact of the tariff particularly damaging for South Africa, despite its minimal economic ties with Iran. One of the biggest trade benefits for South Africa with the US is its participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). AGOA provides participating countries, including South Africa, with trade preferences for quota and duty-free entry into the United States for certain goods. Approximately 22% of South African exports to the United States benefit from AGOA, which amounts to billions in benefits. Trade union Solidarity noted last year that trade with the United States provides jobs to 426,000 South Africans. 93,000 South Africans rely on AGOA for their job security. AGOA contributes significantly to the South African economy and strengthens relations between South Africa and the United States of America. Not a fair trade US President Donald Trump Apart from the AGOA agreement, the latest data shows that South Africa exported goods worth R157 billion to the United States. The biggest exports were precious metals and vehicles. South Africa imported goods worth R120 billion over the last year, including machinery, mineral products, vehicles, and aircraft. This means South Africa has a trade surplus of R36 billion with the United States, which is extremely valuable. Trade with countries such as Russia, Iran, and Palestine, with which South Africa has aligned itself, is much smaller. In 2024, South Africa exported goods worth R5.4 billion to Russia, R359 million to Iran, and R155,000 to Palestine. It imported products worth R10 billion from Russia, R68 million from Iran, and R54,000 from Palestine. Trump’s order, issued overnight, places key South African industries, such as its auto and mining sectors, squarely in the firing line. If South Africa does not immediately sever its trade links with Iran—a move widely seen as unlikely—its exports to the US could face a punitive tax at American ports. Such a tariff would significantly undermine the competitiveness of South African goods in one of the country’s most important export markets. The stakes are high because South Africa is an open economy. More than half of all economic activity—and by extension, employment—is directly linked to international trade, whether through exports or imports. Any disruption to access to key markets, such as the United States, therefore, carries far-reaching consequences, not just for specific sectors, but for the broader economy as well.

The new retail hub, which AJ Property Holdings is developing, is set to become one of South Africa’s most significant retail and property developments. With the mall already generating significant interest, it is expected to reshape the retail and residential landscape of the area. As of September 2025, 90% of the space had already been pre-let, with a potent mix of anchor tenants, including a Superspar with Tops and Vida e Café, Woolworths, and Dis-Chem. Other popular national retailers will include Pep, Pep Home, Ackermans and quick-service restaurants including KFC Drive-Thru and Pedro’s. Legacy Real Estate stated that the selected tenant mix also reflects a high level of retailer confidence in Kingsburgh as a growth node, ensuring that the community benefits from convenient shopping. The mall is set to be a catalyst for growth in the Kingsburgh node, creating employment opportunities during construction and long-term jobs once trading starts. The development also hopes to attract shoppers from surrounding areas, support local businesses and stimulate additional investment in the area. The developer believes that the project, which is just south of Durban, will drive property values upward within the local community. The arrival of major retail hubs will also have a positive effect on the surrounding residential and commercial property markets. The node also benefits from an expanding lower-income community in Baphehli, which is located directly north-west of the site. The average per-capita annual income of the area stood at R81,000 in 2020. Its resident population of roughly 31,357 generated a retail buying power potential of around R800 million. AJ Property Development said that the broader the new development will benefit from its proximity to the region’s dominant retail hub, Arbour Town. Kingsburgh Junction is situated next to Galleria Mall, Arbour Crossing (Value Centre), and Makro, and is just 4.5 km from the site. While Arbour Town operates as a super-regional shopping destination, the new mall aims to operate as a high-demand convenience retail centre, complementing the nearby Seadoone Mall. The aim is to meet the unmet consumer demand in the surrounding middle-income suburbs of Doonside, Doon Heights, Shulton Park, Warner Beach, and lower Amanzimtoti. Property growth The developer views the shopping centre as more than a retail destination, but also a catalyst for urban renewal. “By anchoring the area with nationally recognised brands and modern facilities, the project will position Kingsburgh as a highly desirable location for families, businesses, and investors,” said Legacy Real Estate. The ripple effects are expected to include increased residential demand for properties near the mall, new commercial opportunities for businesses looking to leverage the consumer base and infrastructure upgrades. The broader South Coast area has quickly become one of South Africa’s new semi-retirement hotspots, attracting a host of buyers from inland provinces, including Gauteng. The KZN South Coast is gaining recognition for offering an affordable coastal lifestyle and easy accessibility, attracting families, retirees and investors from across the country. Some of the most notable drawcards are the area’s Blue Flag beaches, a warm sub-tropical climate, popular golf courses and the relaxed way of life.

Speaking in an interview with BizNews , Heystek said the financial strain on South Africa’s middle class has been building for years. He added that many people are only now starting to confront uncomfortable realities about declining wealth and shrinking opportunities. Heystek said the core problem is South Africa’s long-term economic stagnation, particularly the steady decline in GDP per capita. “For the last 15 years, South Africa’s GDP per capita has been declining,” he said. “People don’t think it’s an issue, but it’s a massive number over time. If per capita income shrinks year after year, someone in that group is getting poorer all the time.” According to Heystek, the middle class has borne the brunt of this trend. He noted that since 2010 or 2011, the middle class in South Africa has steadily become poorer. “That’s not an opinion—those are facts, and there’s no disputing the facts,” he said. He pointed to the cumulative impact of taxes and rising costs on salaried earners. “After income tax, dividend tax, VAT, capital gains tax, and then estate duty on death, there’s not much personal wealth being created by the middle class,” Heystek said. “If you earn R40,000 or R50,000 a month, or even more, after living expenses and taxes, there’s very little left.” At the same time, traditional wealth-building assets have disappointed. For many years, the JSE didn’t give great returns, property prices outside of Cape Town have been a disaster, and the rand has declined. “If you price your assets in dollars today and then travel to London or the US, your purchasing power has been decimated,” he said. Heystek said the squeeze is visible everywhere. Middle-class people are struggling to afford medical aid, so they downgrade. They drive cars for longer. He added that motor vehicle sales have dropped from nearly a million a year to about 400,000 because they drive cars for longer. That’s a reflection of the tremendous squeeze on middle-class wealth. Despite a recent improvement in sentiment, Heystek warned against confusing market calm with economic recovery. “There is a higher degree of optimism, and the government of national unity has calmed the markets,” he said. “But the economy itself is still flatlining. Manufacturing is shrinking, and the trade surplus improved because imports collapsed, not because things got better.” Not about pessimism, but realism Brenthurst Wealth Management founder Magnus Heystek He stressed that recent market gains were driven by global factors rather than domestic reform. “We’ve had a tremendous commodity boom, the dollar dropped sharply, commodities went through the roof, and gold shares exploded,” Heystek said. “That had nothing to do with ANC policy. It was pure luck.” This disconnect is why Heystek remains cautious. “Despite the stronger rand and higher JSE, foreign investors are buying South African bonds, not equities. Even large fund managers say they see better opportunities offshore.” For individuals, this reality has major implications for retirement planning. Heystek said many South Africans were misled about retirement annuities. “Advisers focus on the upfront tax saving, but they don’t tell you that you lose control of your money for life,” he said. “You only get access to a third after 55, and the rest is taxed as income later. That’s tax deferral, not tax saving.” He stressed that relying solely on regulated retirement products is dangerous. “You need a large discretionary pot of money under your control,” Heystek said. “That’s money you can move between asset classes and jurisdictions when you need to. That flexibility has made massive differences to people’s outcomes.” Heystek said the past year showed the power of staying invested globally. “Last year was a melt-up market like I haven’t seen in 30 years,” he said. “Gold shares were up 180%, South African equities about 50%, Japan 44%, and some offshore funds delivered 40% in dollar terms. You could only benefit from that if you had discretionary, offshore exposure.” Looking ahead, Heystek said South Africa remains a country of extremes. “It’s a phenomenal country in many respects, but also a precarious one,” he said. For anyone who chooses to remain in South Africa, he advised having a diversified portfolio, with a large portion invested abroad. “Most of my clients don’t want to emigrate, especially at an older age. But they have a very large exposure to offshore assets, and they’re comfortable with that,” Heystek said. He added that offshore diversification is not about pessimism, but realism. “People are saying that their life is here in South Africa, and they’ll die here,” Heystek said. “But I’m going to make sure my children and grandchildren have options. That means investing globally and protecting your purchasing power.” Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Finance · 1h The tide is turning for South Africa Lifestyle · 2h The European company taking on Facebook Marketplace in South Africa Lifestyle · 3h The top private school with a 100% Bachelor’s Degree pass and 8 learners averaging above 90% Business Opinion · 4h South Africa chased its greatest business giants away Business Opinion · 5h More good news about interest rate cuts in South Africa Finance · 6h South African rand goes from zero to hero Industry News Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa Partner content Codehesion can build a world-class smartphone app for your business in 2026 Partner content Enhancing post-retirement income with discretionary solutions More News Finance · 7h SARS cracking down on one group of South Africans Lifestyle · 8h Matric pass rate drops for South African private schools 5 Things · 9h Bad news about driving licence fees, and China slowly taking over major industry in South Africa Lifestyle · 10h Where you can get your 2025 matric results Energy · 10h Best news in five years for Eskom Business · 1d The South African CEO who could create the world’s largest mining company – worth R3 trillion Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

This is according to Izak Odendaal, Investment Strategist at Old Mutual Wealth, and Investec’s Chief Economist, Annabel Bishop. Odendaal said one of the clearest improvements is in inflation. He noted that South Africa now has a formal inflation target centred around 3%, with inflation currently sitting at relatively low levels. “2025 was a good year on the inflation front, and I think the outlook is also pretty good as well,” he said. A stronger rand and lower oil prices have supported some of this improvement. However, Odendaal stressed that inflation has also eased in parts of the economy that are not directly affected by exchange rates or energy costs. “The sectors that are not linked directly to the exchange rate or to energy prices – you’re also seeing pretty low inflation,” he said. This is important for the Reserve Bank, which wants inflation expectations to settle closer to 3%. Odendaal added that this change in expectations affects pricing decisions, wage negotiations and broader economic behaviour. In the short term, he expects inflation to rise slightly before stabilising again. “It’ll probably creep up over the next couple of months, but then it reaches a base and then starts declining again,” he said. This environment made it possible for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates in November, with expectations playing a key role. “Expectations are so very, very important,” Odendaal said. Lower inflation expectations are also beginning to influence wage negotiations. Odendaal points to reports of unions reacting negatively to wage offers just above 5%. “A couple of years ago, that initial offer to the union would have been 8 or 9 or 10%”. He believes the reference point for negotiations has shifted lower and will continue to adjust over time, even if the process is uncomfortable. South Africa’s long experience with higher inflation, he added, is why the inflation shock of 2022 and 2023 felt less severe locally than in Europe or the US. Signs of cautious optimism Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop Odendaal did caution that risks remain, particularly from fuel, food and administered prices. Interest rates have also declined meaningfully, with prime falling from 11.75% to around 10.25%. Odendaal believes there is room for further cuts, although he expects a cautious approach due to global uncertainty. If conditions allow, he said South Africa could see another two or three quarter-point cuts by the end of next year. Beyond inflation and rates, Odendaal pointed to incremental improvements elsewhere. South Africa has exited the grey list, credit ratings have stabilised, and S&P has upgraded the country. Economic growth has also moved above the sub-1% levels that characterised much of the past decade, with forecasts suggesting growth just above 1% next year. While this is modest, he noted that load shedding has eased, logistics reforms are under way, private sector involvement is increasing, and political uncertainty has reduced. Bond yields have also fallen, easing pressure on government finances. “We’re kind of climbing our way out of this hole that we’ve been in for at least the last decade,” he said. Bishop shared a similar view, describing the outlook as one of “early signs of cautious optimism”. She expects GDP growth of around 1.5% to 1.6% in 2026, supported by lower inflation and interest rates. A key driver has been stronger global commodity prices, particularly for metals. “Our largest exports are in fact metals,” she said, with higher prices improving export earnings and supporting the rand. Bishop also pointed to lower fuel prices, interest rate cuts in South Africa and the US, and a rebound in agriculture following a strong 2025 season. Together, these factors are contributing to modest inflation and slightly faster growth. While global risks remain, including geopolitics and oil prices, Bishop said current market conditions have been supportive for emerging markets like South Africa. She added that domestic reforms are increasingly important. Progress under Operation Vulindlela, including improvements at Eskom and Transnet and South Africa’s exit from the grey list, has helped stabilise the economy. Financial markets have responded, with government bond yields at their lowest levels in about seven years. While Bishop cautions that credit rating improvements will be gradual, she noted that the overall environment is more stable than it has been in some time, with a clearer platform for moderate growth going into 2026.

Yaga offers secure and accessible payment and shipping options, with a primary draw being the built-in shipping options, including Pudo, Paxi, PostNet-to-PostNet, and Aramex. While there are no selling fees, buyers will pay an additional ‘buyer protection fee,’ which offers refunds for misrepresented items and fraud protection through an escrow system. An escrow is a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and disburses money or goods on behalf of the transacting parties. Disbursement is contingent upon the conditions agreed upon by the parties. The platform’s products are typically 50% to 80% cheaper than buying the same products new. The localised logistics also protect buyers and sellers, with fraudsters plentiful in South Africa. The company was founded by Aune Aunapuu in Estonia, coming up with the idea for Yaga after working as an environmental consultant. Speaking with our sister publication MyBroadband , Aunapuu said that she founded Yaga while on maternity leave. Looking to sell a baby stroller, she noticed that all second-hand marketplaces lacked payment and shipping options. Yaga was thus born, which allows users to build their own storefronts. The platform also looks to reduce fashion waste. It is, however, not isolated to fashion, with other products, including second-hand tech, also sold across storefronts. While Estonia and South Africa may seem far apart, Yaga’s decision to establish a presence in South Africa made sense for its founders. With Estonia having a population of only 1 million, Yaga began searching for other markets, as the capital required to start the company would be wasted on a market that small. Due to this, the Yaga team looked globally for a larger market, which took into account Internet penetration, perception of second-hand goods, and population. Africa was high on the list, given that it is in the same time zone as Estonia. South Africa was elected due to its large English-speaking population and its history as a gateway to the continent of Africa. While travelling across South Africa, Aunapuu noted a high number of thrift stores and thrift markets, believing that sellers also need an app to sell goods. The COVID-19 pandemic also provided a boost for the company, despite its launch in South Africa only in January 2020. With all essential services shut down, South Africans were forced online. The company then began to see an increase in transactions, and influencers started expanding the platform’s reach. Millions in funding Aune Aunapuu, CEO and founder of Yaga Given the success in South Africa, Yaga announced its plan to expand across Africa in 2024, with expansions planned for Kenya and Nigeria. The company also received a boost after raising €4 million (about R80 million) in a pre-Series A global funding round in late 2025. This took the company’s funding to €7.2 million (R135 million) since its founding. The company secured the latest funding from Specialist VC, Trind Ventures, Startup Wise Guys, a group of angel investors and H&M Group Ventures, which is a unit of the Swedish retail giant. “We strongly believe in the team behind Yaga, which has clearly shown capabilities to scale its marketplace for pre-loved fashion,” says Nanna Andersen from the H&M Group. “Their presence on the African continent is also a strong complement to H&M Group’s existing second-hand initiatives in other parts of the world.” Yaga plans to become the largest marketplace for second-hand fashion in Africa and the Middle East. Yaga said that it has 2 million users, with over 6 million items sold since its launch in 2017. Sellers have earned over €80 million (R1.5 billion) on the platform, according to its website.

St David’s Marist Inanda is one of South Africa’s leading independent Catholic boys’ schools, located in the heart of Sandton, Johannesburg. Established in 1941, it has a reputation for striking a balance between high academic standards and a strong family spirit, rooted in Marist values. These values include humility, simplicity, and modesty, a family spirit, love of work, presence and “In the Way of Mary”. The school is situated on a 21-acre campus on Rivonia Road and caters to boys from Grade 00 to Matric. By 1948, it had its first matric class, and by 1953, the boys were participating competitively in athletics, swimming, tennis, rugby, football and cricket. In 2023, St David’s opened a satellite campus in Alexandra to extend its Marist footprint in line with its vision and mission. St David’s has over 1400 pupils across the two campuses, offering world-class facilities to support the development and growth of its learners. They are highly competitive in cricket, water polo, rugby, football, and canoeing. The Temba Bavuma Oval is named after their famous alumnus. St David’s Marist Inanda has a big music and arts culture. Their choir has won international awards, and they have a strong tradition in debating and drama. St David’s is consistently among the top-performing schools in South Africa under the IEB (Independent Examinations Board) curriculum. Class sizes for complex subjects, such as mathematics, are kept small, often with as few as 14 students, to allow for individualised attention. Other notable alumni include soccer player Giulio Giuricich, cricketers Dominic Hendricks and Pumelela Matshikwe, and EFF MP Vuyani Pambo. St David’s Marist Inanda 2025 matric results St David’s Marist Inanda’s 2025 Matric class achieved a 100% pass rate and a 100% Bachelor’s Degree pass. “The strength of the Class of 2025 is highlighted in the rare achievement of every single matriculant obtaining a Bachelor’s Degree pass,” Executive Headmaster Mike Thiel said. St David’s said that its overall distinction rate among top achievers builds on a strong academic legacy. One boy achieved 9 distinctions, seven boys achieved 8 distinctions, 10 boys achieved 7 distinctions, and 11 boys achieved 6 distinctions. Eight boys averaged 90% or above, 27 boys averaged above 80%, and an additional 46 boys averaged above 70%. “Notably, the school achieved a distinction rate of more than 30% in 14 subjects and an above 50% distinction rate,” it said. These subjects include Engineering Graphics and Design, Information Technology (IT), Life Sciences, Italian, Mathematics, Mathematics Literacy, and Visual Arts. “This range of subjects is indicative of the diversity of subjects that the boys have the opportunity to take and excel in,” Thiel said. “We thank and congratulate our teachers and extended staff who have worked tirelessly to help these young men reach their full potential.” “Their commitment and passion for education, as well as their personal investment in each of these young men’s lives, are greatly appreciated.” St David’s Marist Inanda photos Subscribe Show comments Autoload comments Must Read Government · 32m AGOA hope for South Africa Lifestyle · 2h 25-year-old foreigners are retiring in South Africa Motoring · 3h Petrol price reality check for South African motorists Government · 5h US sends another tariff threat to South Africa Property · 6h New shopping mall opening in South Africa in two months Government · 8h Important deadline for employers in South Africa coming this week Industry News Partner content A Celebration of Excellence: Trinityhouse’s Class Of 2025 Shines Partner content Business Talk Season 14 – Coming soon Partner content Why South Africa’s top companies love running homepage takeovers on BusinessTech Partner content Investing for Reality: A Laurium Perspective on Hedge Funds in South Africa Partner content Codehesion can build a world-class smartphone app for your business in 2026 Partner content Enhancing post-retirement income with discretionary solutions More News 5 Things · 8h Billionaire Motsepe’s companies seek protection from US firm, and problems for Temu orders in South Africa Media · 8h Journalism Graduates – Apply Today Lifestyle · 10h 2025 matric results: Top-performing private schools in South Africa Government · 22h 2025 matric pass rate hits record 88% in South Africa Business Opinion · 24h Magnus Heystek’s advice to anyone choosing to stay in South Africa Finance · 1d The tide is turning for South Africa Poll Do you plan on voting in the coming Municipal Elections Yes No View results Loading ...

David Shapiro is a renowned stockbroker with over 50 years of experience on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). He managed a unit trust, the Twenty Ten Fund, which won three Raging Bull awards between 2012 and 2014 for its performance. He has successfully navigated various market cycles, economic shifts, and technological changes. His experience and significant role as a business commentator are what make his opinions extremely valuable. In an interview with BizNews , he said South Africa doesn’t have the kind of businesspeople that it used to have in the past. Reflecting on decades in the market, Shapiro said those earlier figures were not just managers but people who influenced the direction of the economy and gave business confidence and direction. Looking back, Shapiro said there is no single explanation for their disappearance, but he identified several forces that hollowed out South Africa’s corporate leadership. One was overreach after exchange controls were relaxed, when companies rushed offshore without sufficient thought. “We had some great leaders, but as soon as exchange controls opened, a lot of companies just went overseas without really thinking about it, and that caused a lot of damage,” he said. Another was the impact of post-1994 transformation policies, which, in his view, fundamentally changed incentives and behaviour in boardrooms, resulting in stagnation. Shapiro said the contrast between past and present leadership styles is stark. Earlier generations were prepared to take risks, challenge authority, and think long term. “If we had the kind of business people that we had in the past, we’d have a different economy, if we had that energy, that foresight, the courage to do what they did,” he said. Today’s executives, by contrast, are very, very competent, but largely unwilling to step outside their comfort zones. “They’re not willing to take big risks,” he said, describing modern CEOs as careful custodians rather than ambitious builders. Red tape is suffocating ambition in South Africa Veteran stockbroker David Shapiro He pointed to legendary figures such as Brian Joffe, Sol Kerzner and Raymond Ackerman as examples of leaders who put South African business on the map. Ackerman, he said, was not just running a retailer but fighting the apartheid government and fighting for the consumer, creating a brand people loved. He argued that today, efficiency has replaced inspiration. “You go to Checkers because it’s cheap. I don’t know if anybody loves Checkers,” he said. According to Shapiro, one of the biggest reasons ambition has been replaced by caution is the regulatory environment. “If you want to do anything in this country, they give you a rule book. They don’t open the doors for you. They don’t roll out the red carpet,” he said. “Instead of enabling growth, regulation dictates how you’re going to build it, where you’re going to build it, who you’re going to employ, who your shareholders are.” As a result, businesses no longer build factories, create ecosystems, and stimulate the multiplier effect. This has transformed the JSE itself, which Shapiro described as having shifted “from being a stage for champions to a battleground for fighters.” He added that companies are no longer striving to conquer markets but simply to cope. “They’re just fighting for survival,” he said. Load shedding leads to solar panels, water shortages in tanks, and potholes to detours. “We just adjust to the circumstances rather than starting a revolution and saying, ‘We’ve got to change this.’” Shapiro argued that modern CEOs are trapped in what he called a “compliance tragedy,” where the primary job is no longer to grow a business but to avoid breaking increasingly complex rules. “The regulations just overwhelmed them. They just haven’t got the energy to go through it,” he said. He added that businesses are now packed with compliance officers instead of front-end growth drivers, while criminals ignore the rules entirely. Shapiro believes South Africa still has immense potential, but unlocking it requires a return to bold leadership and a mindset shift away from mere survival. “We need to build up business people who are prepared to take risks, who are prepared to forge this economy,” he said. Without those voices and that ambition, he warned, the country will remain stuck managing decline rather than chasing growth.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/business-opinion/847598/more-good-news-for-interest-rate-cuts-in-south-africa/,2026-01-17T15:57:06+00:00,,More good news about interest rate cuts in South Africa,,"Business Opinion Luke Fraser 12 Jan 2026 Business Opinion More good news about interest rate cuts in South Africa Luke Fraser · 12 Jan 2026 South Africans look increasingly set to benefit from lower interest rates in 2026, with developments in the USA encouraging further cuts by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). South Africa has seen the repo rate drop to 6.75% over the last 15 months, with the SARB cutting interest rates from a high of 8.25% in September 2024. Interest rate moves by the US Federal Reserve have a significant impact on decisions made by the SARB, as they affect the values of the rand and the dollar, respectively. Investec Chief Economist Annabel Bishop stated that the recent acceleration in US interest rate cuts, following a pause in most of 2025, has led to a weaker dollar. The rand has strengthened by over 10% against the dollar in the first few days of 2026 year-on-year, with much of this linked to the dollar weakness. Bishop noted that US treasuries (government debt) rise when risk rises, as they are a safe-haven asset, strengthening the US dollar. However, with risk-taking now on the rise, traders are selling off their safe-haven assets in search of riskier, higher-yielding assets, particularly in emerging markets. The rand’s strength against the US dollar is very beneficial for inflation, aiding in lowering price pressure on fuel and food. The Rand’s strength against the US dollar tends to be a good sign for inflation, as imports become less expensive. With the USA having cut interest rates by 175 basis points in the current cutting cycle, South Africa trails with 150 basis points in cuts. This has widened the interest rate differential between South Africa and the USA, supporting the rand’s strength and investor sentiment. While financial markets have only fully factored in one 25-basis-point cut in South Africa, Investec sees 50 basis points’ worth of cuts in 2026. Investec anticipates cuts in March and September 2026, lowering the repo rate to 6.25%. It also sees a further interest rate cut in March 2027. That said, the SARB has communicated that monetary policy will need to remain somewhat restrictive for a few years until inflation expectations have subsided to 3.0% year-on-year. “While current market conditions, economic data and SARB policy indicate further SA interest rate cuts this year, much will depend on evolving events this year, and the removal of the US universal tariffs may lower US rate cut forecasts,” said Bishop. Good news might be around the corner Aluma Capital Chief Economist, Frederick Mitchell While cuts are only expected for March 2026, Aluma Capital’s Frederick Mitchell is optimistic that the SARB will cut rates in the upcoming meeting this January. This is due to the rand’s strength against the US dollar, lower inflation and the surging gold price, which boosts South Africa’s reserves. “The interplay of these factors creates a compelling narrative for the SARB. The recent strength of the Rand, alongside a softer US dollar, forms a robust backdrop for managing inflation expectations,” said Mitchell. “In a context where no immediate inflation risks are evident—from both the domestic and foreign economic climates—lowering the repo rate could enhance economic growth without igniting inflationary pressures.” He added that the SARB could provide an impetus for increased spending and investment via a rate cut, especially in light of the ongoing global uncertainties that South Africa must navigate. The SARB convenes its next Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 29 January.

businesstech_motoring,https://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/847608/south-african-rand-goes-from-zero-to-hero/,2026-01-17T15:57:10+00:00,,South African rand goes from zero to hero,,"Finance Staff Writer 12 Jan 2026 Finance South African rand goes from zero to hero Staff Writer · 12 Jan 2026 The South African rand strengthened significantly against the US Dollar in 2005, reaching its highest level in over three years at the end of the year. On 9 April 2025, the rand was trading at R19.77 to the greenback. By the end of the year, it strengthened to R16.67. The South African currency continued its strong performance against the US Dollar in 2026, trading at R16.42 on 12 January 2026. Professor Adrian Saville highlighted that the rand’s strength against the US Dollar pointed to credibility in the country. Saville is a Founding Director of the Centre for African Management and Markets (CAMM) at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS). His focus is on economics, finance, and strategy, and he is one of the most respected voices in the South African financial sector. He stated that over the past year, the rand has appreciated by approximately 14% against the US dollar. This is its best annual performance since 2009. “On its own, that is a price movement. What matters more is what it signals,” Saville said in a LinkedIn post. He explained that currencies, like the South African rand, respond more to credibility than to optimism. “Inflation discipline, policy coherence, and confidence in institutional frameworks shape expectations long before they show up in exchange rates,” he said. When those expectations, like inflation discipline and policy coherence, stabilise, price signals begin to move. “This does not mean the underlying work is done. Currency strength is not a verdict on growth, employment, or reform,” he said. “It is a reflection of how markets are reading the framework within which those outcomes are pursued.” He added that markets are often described as forward-looking, but they are also selective. They respond to consistency and execution even when progress elsewhere remains uneven. “The rand’s recent performance is better understood as a response to institutional signals than as a judgment on the broader economy,” he said. “Credibility compounds. It is built slowly, tested constantly, and revealed in moments like these.” “The challenge is not to confuse a signal with a solution, but to recognise what made the signal possible in the first place.” The rand strength is no surprise Professor Adrian Saville Traders are content with the rand at its strongest level against the dollar in more than three years, according to volatility measures. The South African currency strengthened by 14% against the US dollar in 2025 and continued to gain this year. It was buoyed by record-high precious metal prices and improving investor sentiment, as a credit rating upgrade from S&P Global Ratings rewarded economic reforms. That’s pushed the rand to overbought levels, according to the Relative Strength Index, a technical indicator that some traders use to identify potential turning points. Expected price swings for the rand-dollar pair over the next six months fell to the lowest level in almost 25 years this month. The cost of hedging against rand declines over the period is the lowest since October, which suggests optimism about the currency. “The rand can maintain its strong performance,” said Sergei Strigo, a portfolio manager and co-head of emerging-market debt at Amundi. “The gold price and terms of trade are supportive. Overall market sentiment is bullish. I do not see the rand weakening if this environment continues.” In a further sign of investor confidence, the cost of insuring South Africa’s debt against default over the next five years has plummeted to its lowest level since 2012. The local-currency 10-year bond yield, meanwhile, is at the lowest in a decade, having fallen more than 200 basis points since the beginning of last year. Bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts this year have weighed on the dollar, giving further impetus to rand gains. The South African currency has returned 3.8% in the dollar-funded carry trade over the past month, the most out of emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. “Carry-trade positioning will provide support heading into the new year,” said Hironori Sannami, a foreign-exchange trader at Mizuho Bank in London.

According to Tax Consulting SA, a growing number of individuals believe that leaving the country or renouncing South African citizenship automatically ends their tax obligations. “From a tax-law perspective, this assumption is incorrect and can expose individuals to significant liabilities, often only years after leaving the country,” the firm said. The firm explained that the problem arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinction between citizenship status and tax residency status under South African law. While citizenship is managed by the Department of Home Affairs, tax residency is determined separately by SARS under the Income Tax Act. “These two concepts are legally distinct, and one does not cancel out the other,” said Tax Consulting SA. Importantly, SARS is not automatically notified when someone relinquishes their South African citizenship. “There is no legal mechanism requiring Home Affairs to notify SARS when citizenship is renounced,” the firm added. “As a result, SARS does not automatically amend a taxpayer’s residency status.” This means that a person can cease to be a South African citizen but still be treated as a South African tax resident. In that case, SARS is entitled to tax the individual on their worldwide income. According to Tax Consulting SA, many expats only discover this problem years later. “In practice, individuals often remain unaware of their exposure until a trigger event occurs.” These events can include withdrawing retirement or preservation funds in South Africa, moving money offshore, applying for tax clearance, resolving old tax issues, or planning to return to or retire in South Africa. The firm warned that when this happens, SARS may still regard the individual as a tax resident if the correct process to cease tax residency was never followed. By then, the consequences can be costly. SARS may assess the person on their worldwide income, review several years of tax compliance, apply exit tax rules, and charge interest and penalties. “Because SARS usually only reassesses residency when prompted, incorrect assumptions can go undetected for years,” the firm said. “Once SARS steps in, the taxpayer is often left reacting, with limited options.” A common but risky misunderstanding The firm emphasised that tax residency is unrelated to holding a South African passport. “Tax residency is assessed independently of citizenship,” it said. SARS applies the ordinarily resident test, which examines whether South Africa remains a person’s primary or usual home, as well as the physical presence test, which is based on the number of days an individual spends in the country over a specified period. Where relevant, SARS also considers double taxation agreements between South Africa and other countries. “The domestic tests are based on South African law, while treaty relief comes from international agreements,” Tax Consulting SA said. Ending tax residency is not automatic and does not happen simply because someone emigrates or changes nationality. The cessation of tax residency is a factual enquiry aimed at reaching a legal conclusion. This involves reviewing personal, financial and social ties to South Africa and making the correct disclosures to SARS. “If this process is not completed, an individual’s tax residency status may remain unchanged on SARS’ systems,” it added. Tax Consulting SA described this as a common but risky misunderstanding. “Renouncing citizenship does not remove an individual from South Africa’s residence-based tax system, and it does not end tax compliance obligations,” the firm said. It added that non-citizenship does not necessarily equate to non-residency for tax purposes. With SARS expected to increase enforcement, the firm said expats should act sooner rather than later. “For individuals who have renounced South African citizenship, or are thinking about doing so, an independent tax residency assessment is essential,” Tax Consulting SA said. Waiting until SARS raises questions often removes planning opportunities and increases financial risk.
